{"text": "Hello Alex,\n\nWe are excited to offer you the opportunity to have a certified healthcare worker visit you to administer the Covid-19 vaccine in the comfort of your own home. This is ideal for high-risk patients, those with pre-existing conditions or others who simply do not want to visit a healthcare facility to receive their vaccine. Since this is considered a premium service, we are charging $99. Fortunately, this should be covered by most insurance carriers for qualified patients by going through the claims process.\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out the online form here to make your appointment google.com.

{"text": "To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron \nAmerica\u0001,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we \nhave decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit \ntarget associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of \ncreating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, \nwith any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are \nallocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. \n\nThe previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year \nwill remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. \nTherefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the \ncapital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be \nmaintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership \nPolicy outlined below.\n\nThe cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will \nbe set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC \nprocess for transactions which will continue unchanged.\n\nCapital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge \nat the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured \noff credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred \ncost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. \nTransactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be \npriced based upon the financial impact on Enron America\u0001,s overall credit \ncapacity.\n\nOn transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital \nBook will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the \nCredit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used \nspecifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted \nabove, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out \nto the origination and trading groups at actual cost.\n\nBy sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America\u0001,s \nsources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the \norganization. \n\nQuestions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:\nJoe Deffner  853-7117\nAlan Quaintance 345-7731"}

{"text": "Hi Jay,\nI thought I'd send you some lite reading.  May provide a distraction for you\nfrom your normal day.  This is a first hand account I received from Capt\nGreider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be\ninterested in, but at least it is the true story and account.  Suprisingly\nnot a whole lot different than the media reported.  The ROC vs PROC point\nwas interesting.  Shows the thought process of an insecure government.\nAnyway enjoy.\nDad\n\nAN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION\nApril 12, 2001\nBy Captain Guy Greider\nContinental Airlines\nSince the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.  Navy EP-3\nsurveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with\nmild interest.  This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I\nnever dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched\ninternational drama.\nSomewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese\nGovernments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to\nretrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call\nwas made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas.\nContinental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch\nthis kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took\nshape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes\nin a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State\nDepartment.\nOn Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph\nFreeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told\nme that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue\nmission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without\nhesitation.\nLater we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case\nthe Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were\nunder the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the\nnegotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an\napology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental\ncrew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our\nbags were packed and waiting by the door.\nOn Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to\nsay that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S.\ncrew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing\nsheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight.\nWe would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air\nForce specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and\ncommunications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the\nairplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.\nThe 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows\nof seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know\nthe condition of the\n24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They\nwere prepared.\nWhen our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to\nfly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight\ntime involved.\nThey were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried\n5 very experienced Flight Attendants.\nThey were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and\nBeverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo.\nOur load planner was Mike Torres.\nAt about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no\nearlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire\nexchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We\nestimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in\nHaikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam)\nSome of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s\ninvitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge\nat the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest\nwith our much-anticipated mission so near.\nBy 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather,\nflight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight.\nAgain, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at\nprecisely 2:15 AM.\nThe stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to\nthe airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation\ndatabase of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain\naccess to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is\nnot in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried\nsophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government\nofficials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight.\nThe route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines\nalong the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly\ntoward Hong Kong.\nThis routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace,\nsomething that the Chinese could consider offensive.\nApproaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control.\nAfter establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut\nto expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable\ndistance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing\nour airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The\ninstant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of\nthe plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan.\nWe told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our\nairspeed.\nWe were still on schedule.\nNow we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island.\nCaptain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast\nwith 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS\napproach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many\nother airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an\n11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We\ntouched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to\nilluminate the sky.\nThe local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was\nbeside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the\nairport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut\ndown the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and\nvehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were\nbrought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door.\nThe Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of\ntheir communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were\nalso briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case\nthe Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard\nwas an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the\ntranslator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to\nhave everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents.\nHe collected all of our passports and left the aircraft.\nBefore he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to\ndeplane.\nPeter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and\nservicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the\nwalk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a\nchance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed\nbetween people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft\nand the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and\ndeparture live.\nOnce the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around\nfor any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could\nhappen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who\nwas on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and\ndemanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General\nsaid that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the\ngeneral declaration, which is standard on all international flights had\nlisted the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for\nRepublic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over\nthis.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the\nPeoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them.\nWith the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete,\n2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they\nbolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last\none was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were\nwithdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed.\nIt was my turn at the controls.\nOnce airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the\nbright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over\ninternational waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from\nthe back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch\nover the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He\nwanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft\nCommander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The\nAmbassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and\nthe entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how\nproud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving\nthe lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they\nhad been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job.\nAfter his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the\ncockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had\nhappened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8\nChinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot\nmade 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the\nintercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on\nthe EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at\nthe time.\nThe fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane\nrolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to\nlose altitude.\nThe Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the\nnose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone\ndeparted the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on\nthe right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3\ndepressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating\nairspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the\nforward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and\nwrapped around the tail.\nWe were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The\ndive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000\nfeet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching\nthe aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was\ncertain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan\nIsland.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives.\nThey made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally\nrecognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow,\nthey managed to get the airplane on the ground.\nTheir next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic\nsurveillance equipment aboard the EP-3.\nMeanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and\nwere yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days\nwould be a very uncertain time for them.\nWhen we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated.\nTheir food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese\nrestaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some\ncoffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided.\nThe crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their\nreturn home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner\nfrom the United States.\nThe rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful.\nDuring the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and\nenjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing\nat Anderson AFB was carried live on national television.\nWe taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out\nto welcome all of us home."}

Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at\n\"state sponsorship,\" implying the complicity of one or more foreign\ngovernments. In the words of former National Security Adviser, Lawrence\nEagleburger, \"I think we will show when we get attacked like this, we are\nterrible in our strength and in our retribution.\"\nMeanwhile, parroting official statements, the Western media mantra has\napproved the launching of \"punitive actions\" directed against civilian\ntargets in the Middle East. In the words of William Saffire writing in the\nNew York Times: \"When we reasonably determine our attackers' bases and\ncamps, we must pulverize them-minimizing but accepting the risk of\ncollateral damage-and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terror's\nnational hosts\".\nThe following text outlines the history of Ousmane Bin Laden and the links\nof the Islamic \"Jihad\" to the formulation of US foreign policy during the\nCold War and its aftermath.\n\n*                  *                   *\n\nPrime suspect in the New York and Washington terrorists attacks, branded by\nthe FBI as an \"international terrorist\" for his role in the African US\nembassy bombings, Saudi born Ousmane bin Laden was recruited during the\nSoviet-Afghan war \"ironically under the auspices of the CIA, to fight\nSoviet invaders\". 1\nIn 1979 \"the largest covert operation in the history of the CIA\"  was\nlaunched in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in support of\nthe pro-Communist government of Babrak Kamal.2:\n\"With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistan's ISI [Inter\nServices Intelligence], who wanted to turn the Afghan jihad into a global\nwar waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union, some 35,000 Muslim\nradicals from 40 Islamic countries joined Afghanistan's fight between 1982\nand 1992. Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs.\nEventually more than 100,000 foreign Muslim radicals were directly\ninfluenced by the Afghan jihad.\"3\nThe Islamic \"jihad\" was supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia\nwith a significant part of the funding generated from the Golden Crescent\ndrug trade:\n\"In March 1985, President Reagan signed National Security Decision\nDirective 166,...[which] authorize[d] stepped-up covert military aid to the\nmujahideen, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to\ndefeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a\nSoviet withdrawal. The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic\nincrease in arms supplies-a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987,\n... as well as a \"ceaseless stream\" of CIA and Pentagon specialists who\ntraveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan's ISI on the main road near\nRawalpindi, Pakistan. There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani\nintelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels.\"4\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) using Pakistan's military\nInter-Services Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in training the\nMujahideen. In turn, the CIA sponsored guerrilla training was integrated\nwith the teachings of Islam:\n\"Predominant themes were that Islam was a complete socio-political\nideology, that holy Islam was being violated by the atheistic Soviet\ntroops, and that the Islamic people of Afghanistan should reassert their\nindependence by overthrowing the leftist Afghan regime propped up by\nMoscow.\"5\nPAKISTAN'S INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS\nPakistan's ISI was used as a \"go-between\". The CIA covert support to the\n\"jihad\" operated indirectly through the Pakistani ISI, --i.e. the CIA did\nnot channel its support directly to the Mujahideen. In other words, for\nthese covert operations to be \"successful\", Washington was careful not to\nreveal the ultimate objective of the \"jihad\", which consisted in destroying\nthe Soviet Union.\nIn the words of CIA's Milton Beardman \"We didn't train Arabs\". Yet\naccording to Abdel Monam Saidali, of the Al-aram Center for Strategic\nStudies in Cairo, bin Laden and the \"Afghan Arabs\" had been imparted \"with\nvery sophisticated types of training that was allowed to them by the CIA\" 6\nCIA's Beardman confirmed, in this regard, that Ousmane bin Laden was not\naware of the role he was playing on behalf of Washington. In the words of\nbin Laden (quoted by Beardman): \"neither I, nor my brothers saw evidence of\nAmerican help\". 7\nMotivated by nationalism and religious fervor, the Islamic warriors were\nunaware that they were fighting the Soviet Army on behalf of Uncle Sam.\n While there were contacts at the upper levels of the intelligence\nhierarchy, Islamic rebel leaders in theatre had no contacts with Washington\nor the CIA.\nWith CIA backing and the funneling of massive amounts of US military aid,\nthe Pakistani ISI had developed into a \"parallel structure wielding\nenormous power over all aspects of government\". 8 The ISI had a staff\ncomposed of military and intelligence officers, bureaucrats, undercover\nagents and informers, estimated at 150,000. 9\nMeanwhile, CIA operations had also reinforced the Pakistani military regime\nled by General Zia Ul Haq:\n\"\"Relations between the CIA and the ISI [Pakistan's military intelligence]\nhad grown increasingly warm following [General] Zia's ouster of Bhutto and\nthe advent of the military regime,'... During most of the Afghan war,\nPakistan was more aggressively anti-Soviet than even the United States.\n Soon after the Soviet military invaded Afghanistan in 1980, Zia [ul Haq]\nsent his ISI chief to destabilize the Soviet Central Asian states. The CIA\nonly agreed to this plan in October 1984.... 'the CIA was more cautious\nthan the Pakistanis.' Both Pakistan and the United States took the line of\ndeception on Afghanistan with a public posture of negotiating a settlement\nwhile privately agreeing that military escalation was the best course.\"10\nTHE GOLDEN CRESCENT DRUG TRIANGLE\nThe history of the drug trade in Central Asia is intimately related to the\nCIA's covert operations. Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war, opium production\nin Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets. There\nwas no local production of heroin. 11 In this regard, Alfred McCoy's study\nconfirms that within two years of the onslaught of the CIA operation in\nAfghanistan, \"the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands became the world's top\nheroin producer, supplying 60 percent of U.S. demand. In Pakistan, the\nheroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979... to 1.2 million by\n1985 -- a much steeper rise than in any other nation\":12\n\"CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade. As the Mujahideen\nguerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan, they ordered peasants to\nplant opium as a revolutionary tax. Across the border in Pakistan, Afghan\nleaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence\noperated hundreds of heroin laboratories. During this decade of wide-open\ndrug-dealing, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to\ninstigate major seizures or arrests ... U.S. officials had refused to\ninvestigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies 'because U.S.\n narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the war against\nSoviet influence there.' In 1995, the former CIA director of the Afghan\noperation, Charles Cogan, admitted the CIA had indeed sacrificed the drug\nwar to fight the Cold War. 'Our main mission was to do as much damage as\npossible to the Soviets. We didn't really have the resources or the time to\ndevote to an investigation of the drug trade,'... 'I don't think that we\nneed to apologize for this. Every situation has its fallout.... There was\nfallout in terms of drugs, yes. But the main objective was accomplished.\nThe Soviets left Afghanistan.'\"13\nIN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR\n\\In the wake of the Cold War, the Central Asian region is not only\nstrategic for its extensive oil reserves, it also produces three quarters\nof the World's opium representing multibillion dollar revenues to business\nsyndicates, financial institutions, intelligence agencies and organized\ncrime. The annual proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade (between 100\nand 200 billion dollars) represents approximately one third of the\nWorldwide annual turnover of narcotics, estimated by the United Nations to\nbe of the order of $500 billion.14\nWith the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a new surge in opium\nproduction has unfolded. (According to UN estimates, the production of\nopium in Afghanistan in 1998-99 -- coinciding with the build up of armed\ninsurgencies in the former Soviet republics-reached a record high of 4600\nmetric tons.15 Powerful business syndicates in the former Soviet Union\nallied with organized crime are competing for the strategic control over\nthe heroin routes.\nThe ISI's extensive intelligence military-network was not dismantled in the\nwake of the Cold War. The CIA continued to support the Islamic \"jihad\" out\nof Pakistan. New undercover initiatives were set in motion in Central Asia,\nthe Caucasus and the Balkans. Pakistan's military and intelligence\napparatus essentially \"served as a catalyst for the disintegration of the\nSoviet Union and the emergence of six new Muslim republics in Central\nAsia.\" 16.\nMeanwhile, Islamic missionaries of the Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia had\nestablished themselves in the Muslim republics as well as within the\nRussian federation encroaching upon the institutions of the secular State.\n Despite its anti-American ideology, Islamic fundamentalism was largely\nserving Washington's strategic interests in the former Soviet Union.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the civil war in\nAfghanistan continued unabated. The Taliban were being supported by the\nPakistani Deobandis and their political party the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam\n(JUI). In 1993, JUI entered the government coalition of Prime Minister\nBenazzir Bhutto. Ties between JUI, the Army and ISI were established. In\n1995, with the downfall of the Hezb-I-Islami Hektmatyar government in\nKabul, the Taliban not only instated a hardline Islamic government, they\nalso \"handed control of training camps in Afghanistan over to JUI\nfactions...\" 17\nAnd the JUI with the support of the Saudi Wahhabi movements played a key\nrole in recruiting volunteers to fight in the Balkans and the former Soviet\nUnion.\nJane Defense Weekly confirms in this regard that \"half of Taliban manpower\nand equipment originate[d] in Pakistan under the ISI\" 18 In fact, it would\nappear that following the Soviet withdrawal both sides in the Afghan civil\nwar continued to receive covert support through Pakistan's ISI. 19\nIn other words, backed by Pakistan's military intelligence (ISI) which in\nturn was controlled by the CIA, the Taliban Islamic State was largely\nserving American geopolitical interests. The Golden Crescent drug trade was\nalso being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army (starting in\nthe early 1990s) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In last few months\nthere is evidence that Mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of\nKLA-NLA terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia.\nNo doubt, this explains why Washington has closed its eyes on the reign of\nterror imposed by the Taliban including the blatant derogation of women's\nrights, the closing down of schools for girls, the dismissal of women\nemployees from government offices and the enforcement of \"the Sharia laws\nof punishment\".20\nTHE WAR IN CHECHNYA\nWith regard to Chechnya, the main rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Al\nKhattab were trained and indoctrinated in CIA sponsored camps in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan. According to Yossef Bodansky, director of the\nU.S. Congress's Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, the war\nin Chechnya had been planned during a secret summit of HizbAllah\nInternational held in 1996 in Mogadishu, Somalia. 21 The summit, was\nattended by Osama bin Laden and high-ranking Iranian and Pakistani\nintelligence officers. In this regard, the involvement of Pakistan's ISI in\nChechnya \"goes far beyond supplying the Chechens with weapons and\nexpertise: the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually calling the\nshots in this war\". 22\nRussia's main pipeline route transits through Chechnya and Dagestan.\n Despite Washington's perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism, the\nindirect beneficiaries of the Chechen war are the Anglo-American oil\nconglomerates which are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline\ncorridors out of the Caspian Sea basin.\nThe two main Chechen rebel armies (respectively led by Commander Shamil\nBasayev and Emir Khattab) estimated at 35,000 strong were supported by\nPakistan's ISI, which also played a key role in organizing and training the\nChechen rebel army:\n\"[In 1994] the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence arranged for Basayev\nand his trusted lieutenants to undergo intensive Islamic indoctrination and\ntraining in guerrilla warfare in the Khost province of Afghanistan at Amir\nMuawia camp, set up in the early 1980s by the CIA and ISI and run by famous\nAfghani warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In July 1994, upon graduating from\nAmir Muawia, Basayev was transferred to Markaz-i-Dawar camp in Pakistan to\nundergo training in advanced guerrilla tactics. In Pakistan, Basayev met\nthe highest ranking Pakistani military and intelligence officers: Minister\nof Defense General Aftab Shahban Mirani, Minister of Interior General\nNaserullah Babar, and the head of the ISI branch in charge of supporting\nIslamic causes, General Javed Ashraf, (all now retired). High-level\nconnections soon proved very useful to Basayev.23\nFollowing his training and indoctrination stint, Basayev was assigned to\nlead the assault against Russian federal troops in the first Chechen war in\n1995. His organization had also developed extensive links to criminal\nsyndicates in Moscow as well as ties to Albanian organized crime and the\nKosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In 1997-98, according to Russia's Federal\nSecurity Service (FSB) \"Chechen warlords started buying up real estate in\nKosovo... through several real estate firms registered as a cover in\nYugoslavia\" 24\nBasayev's organisation has also been involved in a number of rackets\nincluding narcotics, illegal tapping and sabotage of Russia's oil\npipelines, kidnapping, prostitution, trade in counterfeit dollars and the\nsmuggling of nuclear materials (See Mafia linked to Albania's collapsed\npyramids, 25 Alongside the extensive laundering of drug money, the proceeds\nof various illicit activities have been funneled towards the recruitment of\nmercenaries and the purchase of weapons.\nDuring his training in Afghanistan, Shamil Basayev linked up with Saudi\nborn veteran Mujahideen Commander \"Al Khattab\" who had fought as a\nvolunteer in Afghanistan. Barely a few months after Basayev's return to\nGrozny, Khattab was invited (early 1995) to set up an army base in Chechnya\nfor the training of Mujahideen fighters. According to the BBC, Khattab's\nposting to Chechnya had been \"arranged through the Saudi-Arabian based\n[International] Islamic Relief Organisation, a militant religious\norganisation, funded by mosques and rich individuals which channeled funds\ninto Chechnya\".26\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nSince the Cold War era, Washington has consciously supported Ousmane bin\nLaden, while at same time placing him on the FBI's \"most wanted list\" as\nthe World's foremost terrorist.\nWhile the Mujahideen are busy fighting America's war in the Balkans and the\nformer Soviet Union, the FBI-operating as a US based Police Force- is\nwaging a domestic war against terrorism, operating in some respects\nindependently of the CIA which has-since the Soviet-Afghan war-supported\ninternational terrorism through its covert operations.\nIn a cruel irony, while the Islamic jihad-featured by the Bush\nAdminstration as \"a threat to America\"-is blamed for the terrorist assaults\non the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, these same Islamic\norganisations constitute a key instrument of US military-intelligence\noperations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union.\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the truth\nmust prevail to prevent the Bush Adminstration together with its NATO\npartners from embarking upon a military adventure which threatens the\nfuture of humanity.\n\nENDNOTES\nHugh Davies, International: 'Informers' point the finger at bin Laden;\nWashington on alert for suicide bombers, The Daily Telegraph, London, 24\nAugust 1998.\nSee Fred Halliday, \"The Un-great game: the Country that lost the Cold War,\nAfghanistan, New Republic, 25 March 1996):\nAhmed Rashid, The Taliban: Exporting Extremism, Foreign Affairs,\nNovember-December 1999.\nSteve Coll, Washington Post, July 19, 1992.\nDilip Hiro, Fallout from the Afghan Jihad, Inter Press Services, 21\nNovember 1995.\nWeekend Sunday (NPR); Eric Weiner, Ted Clark; 16 August 1998.\nIbid.\nDipankar Banerjee; Possible Connection of ISI With Drug Industry, India\nAbroad, 2 December 1994.\nIbid\nSee Diego Cordovez and Selig Harrison, Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story\nof the Soviet Withdrawal, Oxford university Press, New York, 1995.

But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering. \nYou monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard. \nWhat lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our WorldTradeCenter, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed. \nDid you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. \nDid you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. \nDid you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together. \nLet me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God. \nSome people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals. \nIN PAIN \nYes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United Statesand, probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before. \nBut there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice. \nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future. \nIn the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined. \nTHE STEEL IN US \nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. \nAs Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish. \nSo I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just started. \nBut you're about to learn.\nSabrina Pyke\nAWC, Incorporated\nIntegrated Supply Division\n(713) 944-2100sabrina.pyke@awc-inc.com \n "}

{"text": "A colleague has sent you this article from Fortune (http://www.fortune.com ).\nReply to your colleague at beth.cherry@enform.com \n \n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nWHILE YOU WERE OUT\nReal Jobs for Unreal People\nThings to do after the before.\nStanley Bing\nMon Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2001\nWith the collapse of the new economy, a host of formerly employed people  are now formerly employed. Having developed their skills in the nouveau  operating environment, these ex-operators are now roaming the  brick-and-mortar business establishments of the nation and the world,  looking for ways to transfer their digital abilities to analog  assignments. \nUnfortunately, the capabilities that were valued in the halcyon days of  derring-do and flimflammery don't automatically translate to our current  situation. Yet those in the digital diaspora have enormous gifts that  took them to the top of their now defunct professions! Many are young  and good-looking. All they need, as a group, is a little help turning  the things they know into jobs that actually need to be done. As a  public service, then, let's look at some now dysfunctional functions and  how they may be morphed into lucrative gigs in the global here and now. \nBefore: Web designer. Back when the Internet was cooking, there  were many, many jobs for people who designed the product. There were  sites dedicated to delivering Chinese food to your house if you wanted  it, free of charge. Others would provide you with information about  classmates you had no use for 20 years ago, free of charge. There were  online phone books, in case you had lost yours. And every site needed  designers to make all the little boxes that said things like OKAY and NO  THANKS. \nAfter: tattoo artist. Many of the people who were dedicated to  the Internet economy now seem to have tattoos, and need people to design  and draw them. Although this work doesn't pay as much as Web design, its  product lasts longer. Best of all, any stock options you receive are  likely to be worth about as much as those you got in your old job. \nBefore: vice president, dot-com sales and marketing. Internet  companies needed more positioning than a heifer in heat. The people in  charge of this process had to know how to take the concept of the new  company, slice it up into tiny pieces, and serve it to advertisers and  consumers. \nAfter: meat handler. A cow is likewise inedible until it is cut  up into digestible pieces and cooked. It takes only a little study and a  slightly stronger stomach to make the transition to this sector of the  service economy. \nBefore: dot-com investment banker. Trillions were raised by jolly  salespeople able to persuade otherwise conservative investors to pony up  vast sums on little more than vapors. Some of the ideas seem rather  foolish now, and the valuations placed on these companies  appear...optimistic? Recently one smart company wrote down investments  that are now worth some $48 billion less than they were a few years ago.  This is a testament to the power that messianic investment bankers  infused into the market. Shall that talent go to waste? \nAfter: shaman, Pulau Tiga, Malaysia. Not at all. The power of the  shaman lies in the faith he or she is able to produce in the village.  Shamans are looking for folks who believe in them implicitly because of  their ability with words and their impressive makeup and feathers. \nBefore: tech sector stockbroker. In many ways, the stockbroker  was the most important player of all, once the initial money had been  raised. For while many who were involved in new-economy enterprises  believed that the product on the screen was their raison d'etre, the  real activity of the average dot-com was selling securities. The fact  that these entities were being merchandised without benefit of business  plan, cash flow, or even, much of the time, common sense only makes the  achievement of these professionals more admirable. \nAfter: ice salesman, Alaska. Around the globe, people want to buy  stuff simply because it is offered to them. Does anyone really need hot  dogs that plump when you cook them? Sneakers whose heels light up when  you walk? Wine that costs $400 a bottle? A car the size of a hotel room?  Cheese puffs? The genius of our system is that it creates opportunities  for those with the gift for making others part with their money happily,  simply for the pleasure of exercising the right to spend. Nobody is  better prepared to shoulder that burden. \nBefore: new-media journalist. None of this would have been  possible without the staunch efforts of the journalist pundits who  prognosticated until they could prognosticate no more. The Internet was  going to replace radio, television, human speech, the microwave, sex,  drugs, and the music business. To date, it has replaced nothing but  itself. \nAfter: high school cheerleader. They leap! They dance! They know  which team they're on. True, standards for physical attractiveness and  fitness will have to be relaxed when these members of the fourth estate  run onto the playing field, but that's a fair trade for the verve that  they will bring to any assignment. \nBefore: president and chief operating officer. This was a big  title. But the wired operating chief mostly had the job of running  around and making sure everybody got what he needed. There was little  glamour. There was a lot of worrying and aggravation as the boss lurched  around in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole trying to beat all the  challenges back with a stick. And it was the prez who was the first to  see that the conceptual emperor was walking around with nothing but his  prospectus in his hand. \nAfter: fast-food chef. How much more fun will this job be! Food  is something you can touch, smell, and, obviously, taste. No doubt the  pressure at mealtime can get intense, but it's nothing next to the heat  felt when the 30-year-old CFO announced the company was down to its last  $30 million. \nBefore: chairman and CEO, big dotcom.com. The chairman, on the  other hand, was about as important to the dot-com nation as Mount  Rushmore is to the governance of the U.S. It's nice that it's there. It  lends to the majesty of everything. Big face? Sure. But function? No. \nAfter: bathrobe model. They have styles so nice these days that  you can greet visitors in them and they won't know you just woke up.  After a few years at this challenging assignment, you can graduate to  being a management consultant. \nBefore: workout specialist. When it was all over, these folks  came in to mop up the broken glass, reblow it, and heave it out there  for another round. The workout job is a painful one but as cleansing and  necessary a part of the process as any other. Now that the workouts are  all but over, however, these gifted specialists are at liberty and  looking for apt employment. \nAfter: proctologist. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do  it. \n http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&doc_id=203860 \nColleague at Fortunehttp://www.fortune.com "}
