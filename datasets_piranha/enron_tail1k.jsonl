This is  an actual \npetition, and \"signatures\" \nwill be lost if you drop the  line. \n  \n  \nPlease take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your \npart. And be sure to include other members of your  \nhousehold who are willing to sign. \nPetition to the United Nations  Background Information: \nMadhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war \nupon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996, \nwomen have had to wear burqua and have been \nbeaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper \nattire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh \ncovering in front of their eyes. One woman \nwas beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists \nfor accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was \ndriving. Another was stoned to death for \ntrying  to leave the country with a man that was not a \nrelative. \nWomen are not allowed to work  or even go out in public \nwithout a male relative; professional women such  as \nprofessors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and \nwriters have  been forced from their jobs and \nrestricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is \npresent must have their windows painted so that she \ncan never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent \nshoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear \nof their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because \nthey cannot work, those without male \nrelatives or husbands are  either starving to death or \nbegging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s. \nDepression is becoming so widespread that it has \nreached  emergency \nlevels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic \nsociety  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but \nrelief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate \namong women must be \nextraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper \nmedication and treatment for severe depression and  \nwould rather take their lives than live in such \nconditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a \nreporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies \nlying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their \nburqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but \nslowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were \nseen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or  \ncrying, most of them in fear. \nIt is at the point where the  term \"human rights \nviolations\" has become an understatement. Husbands  \nhave the power of life and death over their women \nrelatives,  especially their wives, but an angry \nmob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman, \noften to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  \noffending them in the slightest way. Women \nenjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally \nas they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public \nalone until only 1996. The rapidity of this \ntransition is the  main reason for the depression and \nsuicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or \nsimply used to basic human freedoms are now \nseverely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the \nname of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not \ntheir tradition or 'culture', but it is  \nalien to them, and it is extreme even for those \ncultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone \nhas a right to a tolerable human  \nexistence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. \nIf we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name \nof human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,  \ncitizens of the world can certainly express \npeaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and \ninjustice committed against women by the Taliban.  \nSTATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current \ntreatment of women in Afghanistan is completely  \nUNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the \nUnited Nations and that the  current situation overseas \nwill not be tolerated. \nWomen's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it \nis UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as  \nsubhuman and as so much property. Equality \nand human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a \nfreedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan \nor elsewhere. \n1) Giuliana D.

Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. \n\n\tThere are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.\n\n\tSo help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.\n\n\tCheck out the site - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.\n\n\tDavid Oxley\n\n\thttp://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp\n\n "}

{"text": "\nThis has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.\n\nHere's a rundown of events from last week:\n\n\tWe executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.\n\tOur Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.\n-\tThe Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.\n\tThe Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.\n      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.\n\nEven with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:\n\n\tEnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.\n\tEES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.\n      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.\n\nSerious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.\n\nAnd that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.\n\nThank you for your continuing support of our company and each other."}

{"text": "Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. \n\nOccupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South\nYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.\n\nNEC Monitors\nThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.\n\nTurret Users\nAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".\n\nIncreased Information Access\nThere are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:\n\nTen audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:\n \nChannel\tAvaya\tStentophon\t\nWeather Channel\t12401\t801\t\nCNN Headlines News\t12402\t802\t\nCNN Financial News\t12403\t803\t\nCNBC\t12404\t804\t\nMSNBC\t12405\t805\t\nBloomberg\t12406\t806\t\nFinancial News Network\t12407\t807\t\nCNN\t12408\t808\t\nFox Sports\t12409\t809\t\nESPN1\t12410\t810\t\n\n\nWireless Telephony\nYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network \"in-building\" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  \n\nWireless LAN\nThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.\n\nAmtel Replacement\nAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.\n\nKeeping an Open forum\nWe will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"}

The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use the collected intelligence from various sources to \"snatch\" bin Laden and others, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircraft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikely to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.\n\nOver the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that currently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the ground and some special operation forces \"in-country.\"  Also,  British Special Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Advance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a week ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just west of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored AC-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan. \n\nThe ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower, ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups the US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In addition the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron around the HMS Invincible.\n\nAllied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alliance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban.  \n\nDue to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pakistan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and the actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a minimum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their intelligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.\n\n2.\tFiscal Stimulus Outlook\nBy the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus measures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed. \nMost officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preference over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to anesthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate \"bailouts\" that have not yet included anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospects:\n?\tPayroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are probably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directly in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big number if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes into Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be careful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is likely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn. \n?\tAccelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the right medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you have already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the budget flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those who pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, but not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear that they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than \"the rich.\" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in. \n?\tCapital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities for anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off your list. \n?\tUnemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is sympathetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but the totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and health care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into shock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promised them support for some serious version of these programs in return for bailing out the airlines without clogging the debate with \"airline worker assistance\" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-house rebellion. \n?\tCut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be virtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut is something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, but if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worker assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been running into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal corporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay on something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is that companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as assets would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calculated benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirers depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses that companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop. \n?\tInvestment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vast assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by the same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and on which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no way to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the accelerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, there may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies. \n?\tSpecific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaurant and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handicap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on personal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make the cut others will not, but they can add up fast. \n?\tFast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional leaders that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the President would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade deals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democrats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. If he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn't cost anything.\n\nWe will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week since the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time to waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact."}

Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.\n\nAfter weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.

{"text": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.\n\nWe told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.\n\nIt took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:\n\n-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;\n\n-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;\n\n-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;\n\n-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and\n\n-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.\n\nWe've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.\n\nCore Businesses\n\nOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:\n\n-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;\n\n-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;\n\n-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and\n\n-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.\n\nThe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.\n\nI also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.\n\nNon-Core Businesses\n\nOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.\n\nWe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.\n\nBusinesses Under Review\n\nThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.\n\nReviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.\n\nCredit Rating/10-Q Filing\n\nWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:\n\n-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"\n\n-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"\n\n-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"\n\nWe also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.\n\nWe will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under \"SEC Filings.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nIn connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron."}

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:\n\nProducer/Wellhead Group \nThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.\n\nStrategic Asset  Development\nLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.\n\nCentral Origination and Mid-Market\nFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. \n \n\nThere will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. \n\nPlease join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.\n\nLouise & John"}

(Henwood) offers an opportunity to participate in a cutting edge study of the potential collision of coal and gas and its implications for the electric industry as the battle for the fuel at the margin unfolds.\t\n\t\t \t\nThe recent rise in natural gas price over the past year, culminating in a price spike of historic proportions in January 2001 has many industry participants reevaluating the role of natural gas as the \"bridge fuel\" for the twenty-first century. Some observers suspect that low cost gas reserves are tapped out, making reliance on this fuel alone imprudent from an overall portfolio standpoint. \t\t[IMAGE]\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t Currently, there are plans in the works for nearly 40 coal power projects across North America representing 20,000 MW of capacity. Henwood's scenario-based study is designed to cost-effectively enable utilities and project developers assess the regional viability of new, commercially available coal technology using cutting edge screening analysis and their impact on new gas projects.  Participation is limited - sign-up by June 15th to receive the Charter Member price and to participate in the kickoff meeting scheduled for June 20th at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, Houston.

It is\nbeing offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the\nGMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.\n\nCourse details:\n     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron\n\t\temployees\n     - Each course is limited to eight students\n     - Meets once a week for eight weeks\n     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to\n          include initial exam)\n     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week\n     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams\n     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the\n          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.\n     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition\n\nEnron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for\nconvenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their\nown fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is\nsubject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and\nrelevance to organizational performance.\n\n\nHOW TO ENROLL:\n     1.  Print out the attached registration form.\n     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following\n          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:\n          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including\n               your email address.\n          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll\n               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\",\n          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the\n               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.\n               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is\nrequired on the registration form.

Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic\nthat admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work\nexperience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of\nyour application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can\nsubstantially improve in a short period of time.\n\nTHE TEXAS MBA TOUR:\n     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA\nTour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA\nTour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business\nschools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The\nparticipating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.\nThe Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so\ncall\n(800) 2REVIEW to register.\n\nhttp://home.enron.com:84/messaging/gmatregform.pdf"}

Not\na single cloud in the sky. About 70\ndegrees.\n11:55 I decide that we're going to kick\nthe shit out\nof Nebraska.\n11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to\ngo fuck\nhimself.\n12:15 The UT band walks by on the way\nto the\nAlamodome. We're on the second floor of\na two-story\nparking garage on the corner (a couple\nhundred of us).\nWe're hooting and hollering like\nwildmen. The band\ndoubles back to the street right below\nus and\nserenades us with Texas Fight and The\nEyes of Texas.\nAWESOME MOMENT.\n12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,\n50-100 grown\nmen are bumping chests with one\nanother, each and\nevery one of them now secure and\ncertain of the fact\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska.\n1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the\nway to the\nAlamodome. Again, we hoot and holler\nlike wildmen.\nAgain, the band doubles back and stops\nright below us\nto serenade us, this time, however,\nwith the Nebraska\nfight songs. Although somewhat\nimpressed by their\nspirit and verve, we remain convinced\nthat we are\ngoing to kick the shit out of\nNebraska.\n1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,\nsomehow\nmanaging to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11\ncans of beer\ninto my pants.\n1:47 I am in line surrounded by\nNebraska fans. They\nare taunting me. I am taunting back,\nstill certain\nthat we are going to kick the\nshit out of Nebraska. I\ndecide to challenge a particularly\nvocal Nebraska fan\nto play what I now call and will\nforever be remembered\nas \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop\nout for a\ndollar? The rules are similar. I tell\nthis Nebraska\njackass that if he's so confident in\nhis team, he\nshould \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT\nNOW and make\nplane reservations to Phoenix for the\nFiesta Bowl.\nAnd then I spoke these memorable words:\n\"And not\nthose\ndamn refundable tickets, either! You\nrequest those\nnon-refundable, non-transferrable\nsons-of-bitches!\"\nHe backs down. He is unworthy. I call\nSouthwest\nAirlines and buy two tickets to\nPhoenix,\nnon-refundable\nand non-transferrable. Price: $712. He\nis humbled.\nHe lowers his head in shame. I raise my\ncell phone in\ntriumph to the cheers of hundreds of\nTexas fans. I am\nKING and these are my subjects. I\ndistribute the 11\nbeers in my pants to the cheering\nmasses. I RULE the\npre-game kingdom.\n2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,\nI open the\nTraveler and pour my first stiffy.\n2:45 I notice something troubling:\nNebraska is big.\nNebraska is fast. Nebraska is very\npissed off at\nTexas.\n3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.\n9 yards\ntotal offense for Texas. Zero first\ndowns for Texas.\nI'm still talking shit. I pour\nanother stiffy from\nthe Traveler.\n3:36 Four minutes to go in the first\nhalf: the\nTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy my\nfirst $5 beer\nfrom the Alamodome merchants. While I\nam standing in\nline, a center snap nearly decapitates\nMajor\nApplewhite\nand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.\n3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas\n0. I wish I\nhad another Traveler.\n4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska\nfan in the\nbathroom at halftime, I attempt to\nrevive the classic\nBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\n\"Hey, buddy,\nniiiiiiiiice cock.\" He is\nunamused.\n4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from\nthe Alamodome\nmerchants. I share my beer with two\nhigh school girls\nsitting behind me. Surprisingly, they\nare equipped\nwith a flask full of vodka. I send them\noff to\npurchase $5 Sprites, so that we may\nconsume their\nvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska\nis a bunch of\npussies.\n4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting\nbehind me have\nfled for their lives. I purchase two\nmore $5 beers\nfrom the Alamodome merchants.\n5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I\nam beginning\nto lose faith. This normally would\ntrouble me, but I\nam too drunk to see the football field.\n\n5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm\nsorry, sir.\nThose tickets have been confirmed and\nare\nnon-refundable and non-transferrable.\"\n5:37 I try to start a fight with every\nperson behind\nthe concession counter. As it turns\nout, the\nAlamodome has a policy that no beer can\nbe sold when\nthere is less than 10 minutes on the\ngame clock. I am\nenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:\n\"Why the fuck\ndidn't you announce last call over the\nfucking PA\nsystem??!!\"\n5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in\nmy chair in\ndefeat. All of a sudden, the Texas\ncrowd goes\nabsolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter,\nawaking from\nmy coma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\"\nAlas, the\nanswer is no, we were not winning and\nwe did not\nscore.\nThe largest (by far) cheer of the day\nfrom the Texas\nfaithful occurred when the handlers\nwere walking back\nto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take\na gargantuan\nshit all over the letters \"S\",\n\"K\", and \"A\" in the\n\"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end\nzone. I cheer\nwildly. I pick up the empty Traveler\nbottle and stick\nmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.\n6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as\nI walk back\nto the truck. I would taunt them with\nsome off-color\nremarks about their parentage, but I am\ntoo drunk to\nform complete sentences. With my last\ncognitive\nthought of the evening, I take solace\nin the fact that\nif we had not beaten them in October,\nthey would be\nplaying Florida State for the national\nchampionship.\n6:30 Back in the car. On the way back\nto Austin for\nthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can\nstill salvage\nthe day! I crack open a beer. It is\nwarm. I don't\ncare.\n7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am\nhungry. I go\ninside the store. I walk past the beer\nfrig. I\nnotice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I\nwonder if\nit's any good. I pull a Zima from the\nfrig. I twist\nthe top off and drink the Zima in three\nswallows.\nZima\nsucks. I replace the empty bottle in\nthe frig.\n7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the\nstore. I walk to\nwhere the ingredients are, where the\nperson usually\nmakes the sub. There is no one there. I\nlean over\nthe counter and scoop out half a bucket\nof black\nolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.\nI lean\nfurther over the counter and grab\napproximately two\npounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the\nstore\ngrunting and eating Pastrami. The\npatrons in the\nstore fear me. I don't care.\n8:01 We are in South Austin. I have\nbeen drinking\nwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn\ntunes for over\nan hour. My truck-mate is tired of my\nsinging. He\nsuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn\nhave written\nother good songs besides \"You're Going\nto Miss Me When\nI'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" and that\nmaybe listening to\nonly those two songs, ten times each\nwas a bit\nexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I\ncould just let the\nCD play on its own. I tell him to\nfuck off and\nrestart \"Neon Moon.\"\n8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My\ntruckmate,\nagainst my loud and profane\nprotestations, parks on\nthe top floor of a nearby parking\ngarage. I tell him\nhe's an idiot. I tell him we will never\nget out. I\ntell him we may as well pitch a\nfucking tent here. He\nignores me. I think he's still pissed\nabout the\nBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon\nMoon\" loudly.\n8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers\nstuffed in\nmy pants. We're going to kick the\nshit out of\nArizona.\n9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona\n29. I am\npleased. I go to the bathroom to pee\nfor the 67th\ntime today. I giggle to myself because\nof the\nnew opportunity to do \"the bathroom\nBrice.\" There are\nno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am\ndisappointed.\nI tell myself (out loud) that I have a\n\"Niiiiiice\ncock.\" No one is amused but me.\n9:41 I walk to the bathroom while\ndrinking Bud Light\nout of a can. Needless to say, they do\nnot sell beer\nat the Erwin Center, much less Bud\nLight out of a can.\nI am stopped by an usher: \"Where did\nyou get\nthat, sir?\" I tell him (no shit):\n\"Oh, the\ncheerleaders were throwing them up with\nthose little\nplastic footballs. Would you mind\nthrowing this away\nfor me?\" I take the last swig and hand\nit to him. He\nis confused. I pretend I'm going to the\nbathroom, but\nI run away giggling instead. I duck\ninto some\nentrance to avoid the usher, who is now\npursuing me.\nI sneak into a large group of people\nand sit down.\nThe\nusher walks by harmlessly. I am\ngiggling like a little\ngirl. I crack open another can of Bud\nLight.\n9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid\nthe usher, I\nhave lost my bearings. I have no ticket\nstub. I\ncannot find my seats. Texas is losing.\n10:09 Texas is being screwed by the\nrefs. I am\nenraged. I have cleared out the seats\naround me\nbecause I keep removing my hat and\nbeating the\nsurrounding chairs with it. A concerned\nfan asks if\nI'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it\nso seriously.\nI tell him to fuck off.\n10:15 After the fourth consecutive\n\"worst fucking\ncall I have EVER seen,\" I attempt to\nremove my hat\nagain to begin beating inanimate\nobjects. However, on\nthis occasion I miscalculate and I\nthumbnail myself in\nmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter\ninch gash over\nmy eye. I am now bleeding into my left\neye and all\nover my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to\nmyself, \"I'm\ntaking this a bit seriously.\"\n10:22 I am standing in the bathroom\npeeing. I'm so\ndrunk I am swaying and grunting. I have\na bloody\nnapkin pressed on my left eye. My pants\nare bloody.\nI have my (formerly) white shirt\nwrapped around my\nwaist. I look like I should be in an\nepisode of Cops.\n10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody\nwhite shirt\nback on my body and make my way for the\nexits. I am\nstopped every 20 seconds by a good\nsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me\nwhy I am\ncovered in blood, but I merely grunt\nincoherently and\nkeep moving.\n10:59 With my one good eye, I have\nlocated the\nparking garage. I walk up six flights\nof stairs,\npromise that when I see my friend I\nwill punch him\nin the face for making me walk up six\nflights of\nstairs, find the truck, and collapse in\na heap in the\nbed of the truck. I look around and\nnotice that\ntraffic is lined up all the way around\nthe garage, six\nwhole flights, and no one is moving. I\ntake a nap.\n11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my\nfriend in the\ndriver's seat. I lift my head to look\nout the bed of\nthe truck and notice that traffic is\nlined up all the\nway around the garage, six whole\nflights, and no one\nis\nmoving. I am too tired to punch my\nfriend. I call my\nfriend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n11:31 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:38 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:47 I lift my head to look out the\nbed of the truck\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\nthe way around\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\none is moving.\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\n\n11:58 I am jostled. The truck is\nmoving. I lift my\nhead to look out the bed of the truck\nand notice that\ntraffic is beginning to move on the\nsecond floor. I\njump out of the truck, walk to the edge\nof the parking\nfacility, and pee off the sixth floor\nonto the street\nbelow. My friend looks at me like I\njust anally\nviolated his minor sister. I turn\naround and pee\non the front of his truck while singing\nthe lyrics\nto \"Neon Moon.\"\n12:11 We are moving. We are out of\nbeer. I jump\nfrom the truck and go from vehicle to\nvehicle until\nsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.\nI return to\nmy vehicle.\n12:26 We have emerged from the parking\nfacility. We\nmake our way to my apartment and find\nEd sitting on\nthe couch with a freshly opened bottle\nof Glenlivet on\nthe coffee table in front of him. We\nare all going to\ndie tonight.\n12:59 We have finished three-quarters\nof the bottle\nof Glenlivet. We decide it would be a\nwonderful idea\nto go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has\nto pee. He\nwalks down the hall to our apartment\nand directly into\nthe full length mirror at the end of\nthe hall,\nsmashing it into hundreds of pieces. We\ngiggle\nuncontrollably and leave for\nPollyEsther's.\n1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs\nuncontrollably\nat our efforts to enter his club.\n\"Fellas,\" he says\nin between his fits of spastic\nlaughter, \"I've been\nworking this door for almost a year.\nI've been\nworking\ndoors in this town for almost 5 years.\nAnd I can\nhonestly say that I ain't never seen\nthree drunker\nmother fuckers than you three.\nSorry, can't let you\nin.\" We attempt to reason with him. He\nlaughs\nharder.\n1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We\ntake two\nsteps in the door and hear \"Last call\nfor alcohol!\" I\nturn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat\nwasn't that\nfuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that\nat the\nAwamo...the awaom...the\nalab...fuck it, that stadium\nwe\nwas at today...\" We order 6 shots of\ntequila and\nthree beers.\n2:15 Back on the street. We need food.\nWe hail a\ncab to take us the two and one half\nblocks to Katz's.\nThe cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10\nand tell him\nto keep it.\n2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give\nthe hostess\n$50. We are seated immediately.\n2:25 We order two orders of fried\npickles, a Cobb\nsalad, a bowl of soup, two orders of\nBlueberry\nblintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a\nhamburger, two\ncheese stuffed potatoes, an order of\nfries, and an\norder of onion rings.\n2:39 The food arrives. We are all\nasleep with our\nheads on the table. The waiter wakes us\nup. We eat\nevery fucking bit of our food. Most\nof the restaurant\npatrons around us are disgusted. We\ndon't give a\nshit.\nThe tab is $112 with tip.\n2:46 I'm sleepy.\n9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.\nShe is the\nbartender at Katz's. She is not pretty."}

{"text": "\nToday, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.\n"}

{"text": "\nToday we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe information provides further details about:\n\n\t-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;\n\t-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;\n\t-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; \n\t-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and\n\t-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.\n\nThis information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  \n\nRestatement of Earnings\n\nBased on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:\n\nNet income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:\n\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 \n\t-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000\n\t-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 \n\t-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001\n\t-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  \n\nThe consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.\n\nThe restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.\n\nYou can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.\n\nWe will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."}

I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts  that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They  want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends,  but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will  probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical  and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got  married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was  thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.   They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it  themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking  for:\nTropical All-Inclusive Resort  \nRound trip airfare  \nTravel date between November 2001 and January  2002 (what time is cheaper?)  \nWedding Services including someone to perform  the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony  (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can  be restaurant at the resort) \n\nI couldn't discuss this on the phone because it  is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next  to me.

They may also be saving the institution of marriage while they're at \nit. \nYou may be like me: between the ages of 25 and 39, single, a \ncollege-educated city dweller. If so, you may have also had the unpleasant \nexperience of discovering that you have been identified (by the U.S. Census \nBureau, no less) as one of the fastest-growing groups in America -- the \n''never marrieds.'' In less than 30 years, the number of never-marrieds has \nmore than doubled, apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the \noldest it has been in our country's history -- about 25 years for women and \n27 for men. \nAs if the connotation of ''never married'' weren't negative enough, the \nvilification of our group has been swift and shrill. These statistics prove \na ''titanic loss of family values,'' according to The Washington Times. An \narticle in Time magazine asked whether ''picky'' women were ''denying \nthemselves and society the benefits of marriage'' and in the process kicking \noff ''an outbreak of 'Sex and the City' promiscuity.'' In a study on \nmarriage conducted at Rutgers University, researchers say the ''social \nglue'' of the family is at stake, adding ominously that ''crime rates . . . \nare highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males.'' \nAlthough I never planned it, I can tell you how I became a never-married. \nThirteen years ago, I moved to San Francisco for what I assumed was a brief \ntransition period between college and marriage. The problem was, I wasn't \njust looking for an appropriate spouse. To use the language of the Rutgers \nresearchers, I was ''soul-mate searching.'' Like 94 percent of \nnever-marrieds from 20 to 29, I, too, agree with the statement ''When you \nmarry, you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost.'' This \n?ber-romantic view is something new. In a 1965 survey, fully three out of \nfour college women said they'd marry a man they didn't love if he fit their \ncriteria in every other way. I discovered along with my friends that finding \nthat soul mate wasn't easy. Girlfriends came and went, as did jobs and \napartments. The constant in my life -- by default, not by plan -- became a \nloose group of friends. After a few years, that group's membership and \nroutines began to solidify. We met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood \nrestaurant. We traveled together, moved one another's furniture, painted one \nanother's apartments, cheered one another on at sporting events and \nopen-mike nights. One day I discovered that the transition period I thought \nI was living wasn't a transition period at all. Something real and important \nhad grown there. I belonged to an urban tribe. \nI use the word ''tribe'' quite literally here: this is a tight group, with \nunspoken roles and hierarchies, whose members think of each other as ''us'' \nand the rest of the world as ''them.'' This bond is clearest in times of \ntrouble. After earthquakes (or the recent terrorist strikes), my instinct to \nhuddle with and protect my group is no different from what I'd feel for my \nfamily. \nOnce I identified this in my own life, I began to see tribes everywhere I \nlooked: a house of ex-sorority women in Philadelphia, a team of \nultimate-frisbee players in Boston and groups of musicians in Austin, Tex. \nCities, I've come to believe, aren't emotional wastelands where fragile \nindividuals with arrested development mope around self-indulgently searching \nfor true love. There are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes. \nSo what does it mean that we've quietly added the tribe years as a \ndevelopmental stage to adulthood? Because our friends in the tribe hold us \nresponsible for our actions, I doubt it will mean a wild swing toward \npromiscuity or crime. Tribal behavior does not prove a loss of ''family \nvalues.'' It is a fresh expression of them. \nIt is true, though, that marriage and the tribe are at odds. As many \nex-girlfriends will ruefully tell you, loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc \non romantic relationships. Not surprisingly, marriage usually signals the \nbeginning of the end of tribal membership. From inside the group, marriage \ncan seem like a risky gambit. When members of our tribe choose to get \nmarried, the rest of us talk about them with grave concern, as if they've \njoined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound. \nBut we also know that the urban tribe can't exist forever. Those of us who \nhave entered our mid-30's find ourselves feeling vaguely as if we're living \nin the latter episodes of ''Seinfeld'' or ''Friends,'' as if the plot lines \nof our lives have begun to wear thin. \nSo, although tribe membership may delay marriage, that is where most of us \nare still heading. And it turns out there may be some good news when we get \nthere. Divorce rates have leveled off. Tim Heaton, a sociologist at Brigham \nYoung University, says he believes he knows why. In a paper to be published \nnext year, he argues that it is because people are getting married later. \nCould it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now \nactually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate? What a \nfantastic twist -- we ''never marrieds'' may end up revitalizing the very \ninstitution we've supposedly been undermining. \nAnd there's another dynamic worth considering. Those of us who find it so \nhard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely, as if it is the \ninevitable next step in our lives, the way middle-class high-school kids \nchoose college. When we go to the altar, we will be sacrificing something \nprecious. In that sacrifice, we may begin to learn to treat our marriages \nwith the reverence they need to survive. \nEthan Watters is a writer living in San Francisco. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/magazine/14WWLN.html?ex=1004477039&ei=1?  \n=35aa1c221eb1c4d3 "}

{"text": "\nAs many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.\n\nThank you.\n"}

Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.\n\nCall with questions.\n\nRJ\nx39934\n\n\n1.\tAfghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate\n\nWith a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.\n\nWord from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.\n\nWhen the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that \"reasonable elements\" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.\n\n2.\tSaudis Feeling Increased Pressure\n\nRefusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.\n\nWashington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.\n\n3.\tPakistan Holding Steady- For Now\n\nPopular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.\n\n4.\tKey Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?\n\nThere is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.\n\n\n"}

{"text": "\nAs you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.\n\nEven though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.\n\nIn addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.\n\nIf you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Every Summer.\n \nKidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.\n \nIn 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.\n \nKidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.\n \nWe are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.

At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  \n\nIt's that easy!\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nweb site: www.kidventurecamp.com\ncall Kidventure: 713.960.8989\ne-mail: camps@kidventurecamp.com\n\nHave News to Share?\nTo post news or events in Enron In Action, please e-mail your information to EIA@enron.com \nno later than 12:00 noon the Thursday prior to the next Monday's mailing.\n"}

{"text": "\nHi Jason, \nTried to call you, but could't get through at 503.464.8637.  Is that the right number?  Here's some suggestions on how to access the data you want:\nPOINTS LIST:  My point list is pretty out of date.  If you have access to NW Passage, you can get to a current list by logging in, go to \"EBB\", then \"Point Capacity\", then hit refresh.  If you want to look at the capacity of a specific point, highlight the point and hit \"Point Capacity\".\nSCHEDULED POINT VOLUMES:  You can look at scheduled volumes at all points, including the \"zones\" that we were talking about, via the scheduling screen.  You must be logged into NW Passage.  Go to the \"Noms\" Section, then the \"Scheduling\" window.  Click on the \"Meter\" radio button at the upper left and fill in the desired date or date range.  Hit \"Refresh\" and the point volumes should pop up and look similar to the view scheduling screen.  You have the option to save this information into a spreadsheet as well as look at volumes for a range of dates.  This should give you the same data as the unutilized capacity report with the addition of the other \"zone\" and throughput volumes.  It looks like a pretty comprehensive list of active points as well.  The scheduling screen is pretty powerful and has a lot of other features as well... you might play around with it or call me to find out what else it can do.\nPlease call me if you have any questions. \nThanks, \nWes Kida \n801.584.6656 "}

{"text": "\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\neSource\neSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.\n\nSince our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. \n\nWe are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  \n\nAs for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like \"Industry Overviews\" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.\n\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nChicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals\n06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nCHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. \nIn the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.\nChicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. \n\"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois.

This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called \"PACE\", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  \n\nToday, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  \n\nThe announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.\n\nNew opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.\n\nI appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.\n\nBilly Lemmons\nVice President,  Associate / Analyst Program"}

{"text": "\nHi Marilyn, \nI am helping a friend plan an \"away\" wedding.  I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends, but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.  They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking for:\nTropical All-Inclusive Resort\nRound trip airfare\nTravel date between November 2001 and January 2002 (what time is cheaper?)\nWedding Services including someone to perform the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can be restaurant at the resort)\n\nI couldn't discuss this on the phone because it is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next to me.  If you could give me a list of resorts we will look over them, narrow it down, and then get back to you.  Thank you so much for your help!\nAshley Landry \nEnFORM Technology, LLC \nOffice: (713) 350-1933 \nFax: (713) 438-1933 \nEmail: ashley.landry@enform.com "}

{"text": "\n \n\nBaby News!\n\nEnFORM,\nIt is my great privilege to announce one of EnFORM  Technology's greatest 'deliveries' since our small company began over  three years ago.   As  you may have heard, on June1st,  at 6:46pm,a small handful of EnFORMers  completed one of the most ambitious technology integration projects in the  history of modern B2B e-commerce initiatives.TrueQuote.com, a web based energy trading exchange, successfully  interfaced it's product and trading transaction engine to the largest  e-commerce site in the world, Enron Corporation's EnronOnline.com. EnronOnline trades approximately $3Billion in energy related products and  services every day making it (by  far)the largest e-commerce platform in  the world.\nThe magnitude of this achievement can not be understated.  Many doubted that it was technically feasible, and many others thought it was  out-right impossible to keep the trading engines of two completely different  platforms completely synchronized. Well, it is with great pride that I report  to you that since going live with the interface, TrueQuote.com (developed  using SQL Server 2000, VB / COM+, ASP, and a whole-lotta XML) not only keeps in  lock-step synchronization with EnronOnline.com (a Java, Oracle8i, and Web-logic platform), the two platforms have exchanged  over 1.25Million orders in just a few weeks, averaging between 50-75,000every daywith  less than a 1/2 second of latency between the two platforms for each  order.\nWhen you get a chance,  congratulate the team for delivering such an impressive achievement.   Since going live, the baby hasn't even burped!\n-Stewart\n \n\n - Baby News Bkgrd.gif "}

Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). \n\nBrent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. \n\nI am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. \n\nBeth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. \n\nBeth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.\n\nMike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   \n\nThanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron."}

{"text": "\n \n\n\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nEnron Global Markets\nEGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date with EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. (\"EGLI\") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into various offtake products, primarily MTBE. \n\nAs a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to convert the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regulatory risk associated with the MTBE market.\n\nPrior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreements, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbon-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicated on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT.  \n\nThese combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.\n\nEGM Fundamentals\nEGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundamentals publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, Andrew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.\n\nEGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's forward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is focused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects include modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumption and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four weeks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested parties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com>) for updates.\n\nEast Power Origination\nThe Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of its kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollution control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm), which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal regulations.  Congratulations to the development team!\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\n\"For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. \"They are just interested in creating a whipping post. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do is take responsibility for the problem they created.\"  Houston Chronicle, July 10, 2001.\n\n\nWELCOME\nNew Hires\nEGM  - Todd Litton\nEIM   - Ayesha Kanji, Matt Christiansen\nENA  - Alex McElreath, Chris Czuppon, Joanne Rozycki, Todd Callaway, Lisa Koerselman, Christopher Davis, Sandra Haldeman\n\nTransfers (to or within)\nENA - Michael Newlin, John Garrison, Cheryl White, Diane Cook, Jennifer Martinez\nEIM - Sylvia Sauseda\nEGM - John Cote, Laura Mireles, Tim Norton, Doris Wilhoite\n\n\nNUGGETS & NOTES\n\nTravel tip of the week:\nOut of Town Calling. Direct calls from hotels are not encouraged. When calling to the Enron Building, 3 Allen Center or Omaha, use of the 1-800-97-ENRON is often the most cost effective method.  For other locations, dial 1-800-96-ENRON, enter the number you are calling and then your AT&T corporate calling card number.  Please contact your Lan support department for 1-800 dial-in numbers for cost effective remote connections.\n\nGlobal Strategic Sourcing: UPS\nAs part of the recently negotiated agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS), Enron employees may now utilize two new letter centers when sending packages after hours.  These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.  \n\nLetter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18\"x 13\" x 3\" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.  Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.\n\nContact: Glenn Lewis, Global Strategic Sourcing contract manager at 713-646-7512.\n\n\nEnronOnline Statistics\n\nBelow are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of July 12, 2001:\n\n     \tTotal Life to Date Transactions > 1,180,000\nLife to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $696 billion\n\n\nNEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH\n\nEnron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany \nCongratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first physical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be taking gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base load.\n\nIn connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team completed a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbent player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside Germany in order to close the gas supply deal.  \"Although we are happy that we have successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contractual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four network operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the negotiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transport from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France,\" commented Carsten Haack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke and Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important element of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first transportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after Ruhrgas. \"This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, especially in East Germany, \" said Haack. \"But more importantly, this deal will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to customers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!\" he added.\n\nETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont\nCongratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a series of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wilton International.\n\nA new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two million tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plants. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the provision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, security and emergency response.\n\nPaul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: \"Securing an exclusive long-term supply agreement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achievement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current contract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the operation of their respective assets.\"\n\n\nEnron's Northernmost Partner!\nEnron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Varanger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partnership will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperature risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian market generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.\n\nThis is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationships in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varanger has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in cooperation with Russian partners to manage the water storage. \n\n\nLEGAL STUFF\nThe information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.

He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.\n\n\tI would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.\n\nThe most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.\n\nWest Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     \n\nThe West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.\n  \nPlease review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael D. Grigsby\nWest Gas Trading\n "}

{"text": "\n\n\nKaren Denne, vice president of Public Relations, received some interesting questions about Enron's dealings with the media in her eSpeak session on July 24.  Here's one of them:\n\nI am new to Enron, and the \"pie in the face\" incident occurred just after I began working here. I have had several friends ask me about that. My questions are: 1) How did we \"spin\" this issue (i.e., the problems with Cal. AND the fact that we got pie thrown on one of our main players) 2) Was he mad about it, or did he laugh it off? 3) Is this a pie incident kind of a good thing, because it gets people talking about the issues and Enron or do we look silly?\n\nWant to know how she responded?  Check out her full eSpeak transcript at http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a new feature in the IdeaVault!

Our next Golf Tournament will be held March 25, 2002.  Even though it is 9 months away, this committee works year round to find sponsors, golfers, and golf teams as well as arranging awards, golf goodies, etc.  This is a GREAT networking opportunity and LOTS of fun.\n\nFundraising - This group will create creative and innovative ideas to help raise funds for Cougars@Enron.  This will allow us to provide more receptions, bigger tailgate parties and goodies to all alumni.\n\nTailgate Parties - Jeff McClellan, past President, is still Chair for this committee.  This group will assist in finding sponsors for food and beverage, help set up the area (tent is done for us) and think of creative ideas to increase attendance.\n\nHappy Hours (need Chair) - Think of places to hold happy hours, schedule with those establishments, negotiate food and beverage discounts and bring in guest speakers.\n\nBrown Bags (need Chair) - Schedule guest speakers and room for Brown Bags.  Topics can include UH Education, UH Sports or Enron information.\n\nSocial Committee (need Chair) - This group will schedule and plan the Christmas Party and any other large social events.

Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Canadian Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, DWR will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved. \n\"We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,\" Hidalgo said. \"What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Canadian for gas. \n\"It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so.\" \nDWR is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said Hidalgo, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements. \nIn addition to the Canadian company, the five other gas marketers with which DWR is talking are: BP Energy Co.; Coast Energy Group; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Dynegy Marketing and Trade; and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.

SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.\n\nIf there's anything else, let me know.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTholt, Jane M.  \nSent:\tThursday, August 09, 2001 10:44 AM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tSocal Storage Projects\n\nCan you provide the West Desk with an update on the Socal Storage projects-Socal Montebello Salvage Project ;Alsio Canyon and Lo goleta Cushion Gas Projects  Would like to  have something by this afternoon if possible.\n  \n"}

{"text": "\n \nSubject: United States One Dollar Bill \n   \n\nTHE UNITED STATES \nONE DOLLAR BILL \nTake out a one  dollar bill, and look at it. The one dollar bill you're \nlooking at first  came off the presses in 1957 in its present design.  This \nso-called  paper money is in fact a cotton and linen blend, with red and blue \nminute  silk fibers running through it.  It is actually material. We've all  \nwashed it without it falling apart. A special blend of ink is used, the  \ncontents we will never know. It is overprinted with symbols and then it is  \nstarched to make it water resistant and pressed to give it that nice crisp  \nlook. \nIf you look on the front of the bill, you will see the  United States Treasury \nSeal. On the top you will see the scales for a  balanced budget. In the center \nyou have a carpenter's square, a tool used  for an even cut. Underneath is the \nKey to the United States Treasury. That's  all pretty easy to figure out, but \nwhat is on the back of that dollar bill  is something we should all know. \nIf you turn the bill over, you will see two  circles. Both circles, together, \ncomprise the Great Seal of the United  States.  The First Continental Congress \nrequested that Benjamin  Franklin and a group of men come up with a Seal. It \ntook them four years to  accomplish this task and another two years to get it \napproved. \nIf you look at the  left-hand circle, you will see a Pyramid. Notice the face \nis lighted, and  the western side is dark.  This country was just beginning.  \nWe  had not begun to explore the West or decided what we could do for Western  \nCivilization.  The Pyramid is un-capped, again signifying that we were  not \neven close to being finished.  Inside the capstone you have the  all-seeing \neye, an ancient symbol for divinity.  It was Franklin's  belief that one man \ncouldn't do it alone, but a group of men, with the help  of God, could do \nanything. \n\"IN GOD WE TRUST\" is on this currency. The Latin  above the pyramid, ANNUIT \nCOEPTIS, means, \"God has favored our  undertaking.\"  The Latin below the \npyramid, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, means,  \"a new order has begun.\" At the base of \nthe pyramid is the Roman Numeral for  1776.  \nIf  you look at the right-hand circle, and check it carefully, you will learn  \nthat it is on every National Cemetery in the United States.  It is also  on \nthe Parade of Flags Walkway at the Bushnell, Florida National Cemetery,  and \nis the centerpiece of most hero's monuments.  Slightly modified, it  is the \nseal of the President of the United States, and it is always visible  whenever \nhe speaks, yet very few people know what the symbols  mean.  \nThe Bald Eagle was selected as a symbol for victory for  two reasons: First, \nhe is not afraid of a storm; he is strong, and he is  smart enough to soar \nabove it.  Secondly, he wears no material  crown.  We had just broken from the \nKing of England.  Also, notice  the shield is unsupported.  This country can \nnow stand on its  own.  At the top of that shield you have a white bar \nsignifying  congress, a unifying factor.  We were coming together as one  \nnation.  In the Eagle's beak you will read, \"E PLURIBUS UNUM\", meaning,  \"one \nnation from many people\". \nAbove the Eagle, you have thirteen stars,  representing the thirteen original \ncolonies, and any clouds of  misunderstanding rolling away.  Again, we were \ncoming together as one.  Notice what the Eagle holds in his talons. He holds \nan olive branch and  arrows. This country wants peace, but we will never be \nafraid to fight to  preserve peace. The Eagle always wants to face the olive \nbranch, but in time  of war, his gaze turns toward the arrows. \nThey say that the number 13 is an unlucky  number. This is almost a worldwide \nbelief. You will usually never see a room  numbered 13, or any hotels or \nmotels with a 13th floor.  But think  about this: 13 original colonies, 13 \nsigners of the Declaration of  Independence, 13 stripes on our flag, 13 steps \non the Pyramid, 13 letters in  the Latin above, 13 letters in \"E Pluribus \nUnum\", 13 stars above the Eagle,  13 bars on that shield, 13 leaves on the \nolive branch, 13 fruits, and if you  look closely, 13 arrows.  And, for \nminorities: the 13th  Amendment. \nI always ask people, \"Why don't you know this?\"  Your  children don't know \nthis, and their history teachers don't know this.   Too many veterans have \ngiven up too much to ever let the meaning fade.   Many veterans remember \ncoming home to an America that didn't care. Too many  veterans never came home \nat all. Share this page  with everyone , so they can learn what is on the back of the \nUNITED  STATES ONE DOLLAR BILL, and what it stands for... Otherwise, they will  \nprobably never know... \n"}

{"text": "A VISITOR'S GUIDE TO HOUSTON\n\n1.  First you must learn to pronounce the city name.  It is YEEWS-TUN and it\ndoes not matter how people pronounce it in other places.\n\n2.  Houston has its own version of traffic rules.  Never forget that\ndowntown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets.  The only way to\nget out of the center of town is to turn around and start over when you\nreach Dallas.\n\n3.  All directions start with, \"Go down Westheimer\"\n\n4.  Westheimer has no beginning and no end.\n\n5.  The 8:00am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am.  The 5:00pm rush hour is\nfrom 3:30 to 6:30pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.\n\n6.  If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston.\n\n7.  Kuykendahl (kirk-en-doll) Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do\nnot attempt the phonetic pronunciation.  People will simply tilt their heads\nto the right and stare at you.\n\n8.  The falling of one snowflake causes all traffic to immediately cease.\nFortunately all schools, businesses and city government close when the word\nsnow is mentioned.  (But of course, snow is a foreign substance to most\nHoustonians!)\n\n9.  Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent form\nof entertainment.\n\n10.  Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase,\n\"Oh, we're in Montrose!\"\n\n11.  Construction crews aren't doing their job properly unless they close\ndown all lanes except one during rush hour.\n\n12.  If someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably left on\nat the factory where the car was made.\n\n13.  Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination\nor continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets\nDepartment of the City.\n\n14.  Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent\nresidents.  It will not be any help at all for finding the address you seek.\n\n15.  Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered\nspecies list.  Even they can't help with directions though, as most streets\nare still under construction and have recently changed names.\n\n16.  What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport:\nYour arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main Concourse of any\nterminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised.\n\n17.  Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic.  The bumper\nsticker that reads, \"Keep honking, I'm reloading\" is considered a fair\nwarning.\n\n18.  Exit and entry ramps on the freeway are just the recommended way of\nentering and exiting, feel free to exit at any grassy point you wish."}

{"text": "California\u0001,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several \nmonths.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We \nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.  \nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation \nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California\u0001,s current problem is as straightforward as supply \nand demand.  California\u0001,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased \nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory \nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So \ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result, \npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10 \npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related \nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state\u0001,s regulations \nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for \npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market \nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long \nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In \nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the \nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the \nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine \nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt \nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained \nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep \ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale \nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the \nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California\u0001,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.  \nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new \ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile \nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned \nthe state\u0001,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which, \nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron\u0001,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix \nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the \npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the \nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the \nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a \nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are \ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products \nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from \nthe problems the states\u0001, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We \nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply \npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on \nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001&turnback\u00018 of our \ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California \nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly \nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES\u0001,s market price risk by \nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to \nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them \nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in \nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its \ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron \ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western \npower markets.  Enron\u0001,s primary business is managing risk for our customers \nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more \ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California\u0001,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the \nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market \nand shore up the financial stability of the state\u0001,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia\u0001,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing \nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less \nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply \nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations \ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the \nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and \ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can \nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new \nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.  \nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail \nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand \nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from \nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer \nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands \nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  \nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their \nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State\u0001,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to \ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to \narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover \ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and \ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is \nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, \nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters \nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don\u0001,t work; have never worked; \nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, \nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how \nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it \nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley \nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current \nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in \nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that \nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, \nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in \nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power \ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads \nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the \ncrisis from the media, it\u0001,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron will \ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real \nsolutions to the state.

There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under \nthis category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are \nhitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  \nCurrently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  \nThe problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these \ncounterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the \nproducts after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.\n\nRISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies \nwith Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two \nlegs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment \nof FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the \nappropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for \nFinancial Swaps and not Physical deals.  \n\nIT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked \ncorrectly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will \nmost likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg \nMaintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to \ninstruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so \nlogic can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nDoes a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any \nfurther issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    \n(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a \nCanadian product out of the Houston office?)  \nPlease respond with your thoughts on this subject.\n\nThank you,\nDawn\n3-9353\n\n"}

Nobody gives a damn whether it's Pepsi, RC, Dr. Pepper, 7-Up or\n> whatever - it's still a coke. Accept it.  Doing otherwise can lead to an\nass\n> kicking.\n>\n>\n> 4) We know our heritage. Most of us are more literate than you (read some\nJ.\n> Frank Dobie). We are also better educated and generally a lot nicer than\n> you.  Don't refer to us as a bunch of cowboy hicks, or we'll kick your\nass.\n>\n>\n> 5) We have plenty of business sense (e.g., Howard Hughes, H. Ross Perot,\n> Southwest Airlines, Dell computers). Naturally, sometimes we have small\n> lapses in judgment (e.g., Phil Gramm).  However, we are not dumb enough to\n> let someone move to our state just so they can run for the US Senate.  If\n> anyone tried to do that they would  get a serious ass kickin'.\n>\n>\n> 6a) Don't laugh at our Civil War monuments. If Lee had listened to Gen.\nHood\n> you'd be paying taxes to Richmond instead of Washington.\n>\n>\n> 6b) IF you visit the Alamo, take your hat off and be properly humble, or\n> we'll kick your ass.\n>\n>\n> 7) We are fully aware of how hot it gets and high the humidity is, so shut\n> up about it.  If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen, or we'll\n> kick your ass.\n>\n>\n> 8a) Do not attempt to eat tamales without first removing their corn husk\n> casing. Everyone will instantly know that you're a Yankee.\n>\n>\n> 8b) DO NOT, under any circumstances, complain that the chili is TOO hot or\n> contains no kidney beans, this will get your ass kicked into next week.\n>\n>\n> 9) Don't talk about how much better things are at home because we know\nthey\n> are not. Many of us have visited Northern hell-holes like Detroit,\nChicago,\n> and DC, and we have the scars to prove it.  If you don't like it here,\nDelta\n> is ready when you are. Move your ass on home - before we kick it.\n>\n>\n> 10) Yes, we know how to speak proper English. We talk this way because we\n> don't want to sound like you. We don't care if you don't understand what\nwe\n> are saying. All other Texans understand what we are saying and that's all\n> that matters. Now, go away, or we'll kick your ass.\n>\n>\n> 11) Don't complain that certain areas of  this state  \"smell\" of  oil.  If\n> your livelihood depended on those wells you'd soon learn to love the\naroma.\n> Besides, None of OUR lakes or rivers have caught fire recently.  If you\n> whine about OUR scenic beauty, we'll kick your ass all the way back to\n> Pittsburgh, PA.\n>\n>\n> 12) Don't ridicule our Texas manners. We say sir and ma'am. We hold doors\n> open for others. We offer our seats to old folks. Such things are expected\n> of civilized people. Behave yourselves around our sweet little gray-haired\n> grandmothers, or they'll kick your ass -- just like they did ours.\n>\n>\n> 13) Don't think we're quaint or losers because most of us live in small\n> towns.  We do this because we have enough sense to not live in crime\n> infested cesspools like Baltimore. Make fun of our small towns and we'll\n> kick your ass.\n>\n>\n> 14)  DO NOT DARE to tell us how to cook barbecue. This will get your ass\n> shot (right after it is kicked). Criticize the barbecue and you may go\nhome\n> in a pine box -- minus your ass.\n>\n>\n> 15) Remember, the only reason you are lucky enough to be here in the first\n> place is because we have not pulled the Border Patrol off the Rio Grande\nand\n> put them on the Red River (where they really belong) to keep your ass out.\n>\n>\n> 16) Enjoy your visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Well, he was right. Here's my list,\nwhich I hope you will print in the interest of fairness:\n\nTen Rules for Men\n\n1. Pick up your own socks, underwear and dirty clothes.\nClean the bathroom sink when you are finished shaving. We are\nnot your maid.\n2. When you go to the store, ask if we want anything. If you\nare fixing yourself something to eat, ask if we would like\nsomething, too.\n3. When we tell you we are bothered by something, we don't\nexpect you to fix the problem. All we want you to do is\nlisten and be sympathetic.\n4. We think you look great, even when you lose your hair.\nCombing one side over the top is not an improvement. It looks\nstupid, and we are embarrassed for you.\n5. We cannot read your mind. If you are angry, tell us why.\nDon't hide in front of the computer or TV and pout. When we\nask where you want to go for dinner, don't say, \"I don't\ncare.\" It's childish.\n6. If you need our help to buy a gift for your secretary or\nset up a dinner for your mother, please don't ask us at the\nlast minute. We need time to do it right.\n7. Look around the house and see what needs to be fixed, and\nthen, DO IT. We appreciate a man who takes care of his home.\nJust stay away from our tweezers, kitchen appliances, cuticle\nscissors and other personal items. Don't use them to cut\ncarpet or mix paint.\n8. The way to our hearts is through consideration. Cook a\nmeal once in a while. Wash the dishes. Give the kids a bath.\nWomen love it when a man does these things without being\nasked.\n9. We know shopping is not your idea of a good time, but you\nshould know dinner in a sports bar is not our idea of a\nromantic night out.\n10.We like sex, too, but if we say we have a headache, it's\ntrue. Don't get bent out of shape. Offer us an aspirin, and\ntell us to get some rest. We might feel better later, and\nyour chances will be a lot better. -- Lynn in Philadelphia\n\nDear Lynn:\n\nYour suggestions are A-Number-One-Super. You've covered\nall the bases. If the males who read this follow your\ninstructions, they will be rewarded handsomely.

Unless someone calls you and\n> begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with customers\n> so you can \"concentrate on the big picture.\" You seek admiration for\n> your golf game throughout your life.\n>\n> 3) TECHNOLOGY\n> Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead\n> content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace.\n> Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying but who the hell can\n> tell.

However, we all know what is really causing your \"carpal tunnel\n> syndrome.\"\n>\n> 5) ACCOUNTING\n> The only other sign that studied in school. You are mostly immune from\n> office politics.

Unable to make a single\n> decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you\n> can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other \"Middle Managers\"\n> as everyone in your social circle is a \"Middle Manager.\"\n>\n> 8) SENIOR MANAGEMENT\n> (See above - Same sign, different title)\n>\n> 9) CUSTOMER SERVICE\n> Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your\n> own life. As children very few of you asked your parents for a little\n> cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play\n> \"Customer Service.\" Continually passed over for promotions, your best\n> bet is to sleep with your manager.\n>\n> 10) CONSULTANT\n> Lacking any specific knowledge, you use acronyms to avoid revealing your\n> utter lack of experience. You have convinced yourself that your \"skills\"\n> are in demand and that you could get a higher paying job with any other\n> organization in a heartbeat. You will spend an eternity contemplating\n> these career opportunities without ever taking direct action.\n>\n> 11) RECRUITER, \"HEADHUNTER\"\n> As a \"person\" that profits from the success of others, most people who\n> actually work for a living disdain you.

{"text": "California\u0001,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several \nmonths.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We \nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.  \nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation \nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California\u0001,s current problem is as straightforward as supply \nand demand.  California\u0001,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased \nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory \nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So \ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result, \npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10 \npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related \nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state\u0001,s regulations \nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for \npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market \nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long \nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In \nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the \nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the \nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine \nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt \nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained \nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep \ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale \nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the \nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California\u0001,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.  \nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new \ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile \nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned \nthe state\u0001,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which, \nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron\u0001,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix \nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the \npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the \nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the \nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a \nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are \ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products \nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from \nthe problems the states\u0001, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We \nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply \npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on \nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001&turnback\u00018 of our \ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California \nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly \nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES\u0001,s market price risk by \nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to \nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them \nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in \nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its \ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron \ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western \npower markets.  Enron\u0001,s primary business is managing risk for our customers \nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more \ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California\u0001,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the \nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market \nand shore up the financial stability of the state\u0001,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia\u0001,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing \nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less \nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply \nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations \ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the \nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and \ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can \nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new \nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.  \nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail \nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand \nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from \nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer \nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands \nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  \nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their \nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State\u0001,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to \ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to \narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover \ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and \ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is \nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, \nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters \nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don\u0001,t work; have never worked; \nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, \nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how \nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it \nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley \nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current \nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in \nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that \nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, \nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in \nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power \ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads \nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the \ncrisis from the media, it\u0001,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron will \ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real \nsolutions to the state.

To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a\ncrumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.\n6. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola\nover the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.\n7. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the\nrusted bolt for several minutes.\n8. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap\nthe ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is\nfinished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for\na sumptuous brown gravy.\n9. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy\nclothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will\nhelp loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your\nwindshield.\n\nFYI:\n1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8.  It\nwill dissolve a nail in about 4 days.\n2.

This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I\nnever dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched\ninternational drama.\nSomewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese\nGovernments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to\nretrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call\nwas made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas.\nContinental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch\nthis kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took\nshape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes\nin a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State\nDepartment.\nOn Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph\nFreeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told\nme that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue\nmission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without\nhesitation.\nLater we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case\nthe Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were\nunder the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the\nnegotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an\napology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental\ncrew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our\nbags were packed and waiting by the door.\nOn Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to\nsay that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S.\ncrew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing\nsheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight.\nWe would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air\nForce specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and\ncommunications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the\nairplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.\nThe 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows\nof seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know\nthe condition of the\n24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They\nwere prepared.\nWhen our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to\nfly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight\ntime involved.\nThey were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried\n5 very experienced Flight Attendants.\nThey were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and\nBeverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo.\nOur load planner was Mike Torres.\nAt about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no\nearlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire\nexchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We\nestimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in\nHaikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam)\nSome of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s\ninvitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge\nat the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest\nwith our much-anticipated mission so near.\nBy 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather,\nflight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight.\nAgain, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at\nprecisely 2:15 AM.\nThe stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to\nthe airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation\ndatabase of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain\naccess to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is\nnot in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried\nsophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government\nofficials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight.\nThe route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines\nalong the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly\ntoward Hong Kong.\nThis routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace,\nsomething that the Chinese could consider offensive.\nApproaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control.\nAfter establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut\nto expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable\ndistance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing\nour airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The\ninstant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of\nthe plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan.\nWe told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our\nairspeed.\nWe were still on schedule.\nNow we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island.\nCaptain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast\nwith 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS\napproach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many\nother airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an\n11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We\ntouched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to\nilluminate the sky.\nThe local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was\nbeside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the\nairport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut\ndown the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and\nvehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were\nbrought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door.\nThe Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of\ntheir communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were\nalso briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case\nthe Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard\nwas an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the\ntranslator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to\nhave everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents.\nHe collected all of our passports and left the aircraft.\nBefore he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to\ndeplane.\nPeter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and\nservicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the\nwalk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a\nchance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed\nbetween people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft\nand the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and\ndeparture live.\nOnce the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around\nfor any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could\nhappen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who\nwas on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and\ndemanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General\nsaid that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the\ngeneral declaration, which is standard on all international flights had\nlisted the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for\nRepublic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over\nthis.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the\nPeoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them.\nWith the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete,\n2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they\nbolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last\none was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were\nwithdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed.\nIt was my turn at the controls.\nOnce airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the\nbright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over\ninternational waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from\nthe back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch\nover the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He\nwanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft\nCommander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The\nAmbassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and\nthe entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how\nproud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving\nthe lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they\nhad been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job.\nAfter his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the\ncockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had\nhappened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8\nChinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot\nmade 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the\nintercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on\nthe EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at\nthe time.\nThe fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane\nrolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to\nlose altitude.\nThe Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the\nnose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone\ndeparted the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on\nthe right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3\ndepressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating\nairspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the\nforward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and\nwrapped around the tail.\nWe were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The\ndive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000\nfeet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching\nthe aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was\ncertain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan\nIsland.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives.\nThey made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally\nrecognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow,\nthey managed to get the airplane on the ground.\nTheir next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic\nsurveillance equipment aboard the EP-3.\nMeanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and\nwere yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days\nwould be a very uncertain time for them.\nWhen we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated.\nTheir food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese\nrestaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some\ncoffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided.\nThe crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their\nreturn home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner\nfrom the United States.\nThe rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful.\nDuring the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and\nenjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing\nat Anderson AFB was carried live on national television.\nWe taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out\nto welcome all of us home."}

SO...\n\nMARDI GRAS: what the fuck is it??  well you have heard me talk of it, but\nhere is a quick overview with some helpful links.  mardi gras is officially\nthe biggest party in america.  it is the catholic celebration of fat tuesday\nand ment to get all of your partying out of your system as you enter lent\n(ash wednesday). here are some links for more information and you can also\nemail me with questions.\n\nhttp://www.mardigrasday.com\n\nhttp://www.mardigras.com\n\nhttp://www.fattuesday.com\n\nalso for information about my wonderful city of new orleans\n\nhttp://www.nola.com\n\nhttp://www.neworleans.com\n\nthis year mardi gras day is on tuesday, feburary 27th. but this is just the\nlast and most decadent day, the grande finally so to speak.  the party\nstarts about 2 weeks before and gets more manic as fat tuesday approches. so\nhere are the date options.\n\nmy brothers house is open to us from tuesday the 14th of feburary until\nfriday the 3rd of march.  you will want to be there definately for either or\nboth weekends of the 16th-18th and the weekend of the 22ond-24th.  the later\nbeing more hardcore partying than the first.  if you would like to visit the\ncity and surrounding area (ie. river road plantations, the swamps, the\ncemetaries, etc.) and some of mardi gras you would want to plan for the\nfirst week and weekend.  if your all about not remembering what the hell you\ndid, but had fun, the second weekend through fat tuesday would be your bag.\nof course your welcom for the 2 weeks as well.\n\nWhat we provide.  my brother and i have been doing this for several years\nnow.  it is his job to provide the house and my job to fill it up with the\nmost fun and interesting people i can, thats why you guys are on my list!\nit can really get crazy downtown so my brother and i kind of act as tour\nguides.  also, if enough of us come, we are going to plan a crawfish boil.\n(yes eric, crawfish cajun style! none of that salty cold sweedish stuff) all\nyou have to do is:\n\nemail me when your flight gets in to New Orleans International airport and\neither you can take a cab (real close to my bros house) or someone will meet\nyou there.\n\nthen just tag along with the group or do your own thing.  my brother has a 3\nbedroom house a few couches so chances are everyone (including me) will be\ncrashing all over the place, so bring some sort of backpacker type gear\n(sleeping bag and stuff).\n\nok then.  thats it.  ill be there from the 14th to the 28th, tenitavely,\nwill nail that down soon.  so as we say in new orleans, \"lassiere la bon\ntemps roullete!\"\n\nguidroz"}

{"text": "BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nEnron Industrial Markets\nEnron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a \nnew 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for \ndelivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the \nover-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron\u0001,s Internet-based \ntransaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first \ntransaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber \nbuyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed \nprice transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in \nthe lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product \nprovides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. \nAdditionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron\u0001,s \nincreasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized \nexpertise in financial risk management.\n\nIn addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the \nQuebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest \nProducts Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled \nnewsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill \nnow positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North \nAmerica. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers \nStadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local \ncommunity in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of \nthe St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to \nthe village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. \n\nEnron Freight Markets\nIn March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, \nInc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM \nalso started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its \nfirst month.\n\nEast Power Origination\nOn Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the \nMidway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt \npeaking power plant.  Next steps for this facility include receiving a water \npermit from the South Florida Water Management District and an Environmental \nResource Permit (ERP) from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nEnron Canada\nKen Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on \nWednesday, April 4, as part of the \"Power Breakfast Series\".  His topic was \n\"Moving Forward with Electricity Deregulation.\"  Before his speech, the \nchairman of the Board of Trade commented that \"this was the best attendance \never\" at one of their breakfast meetings.  After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke \nwith reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and \nReport on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the \nOntario power market.\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nJAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan government\nTOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to \nbecome the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan. The move \nbrings Enron one step closer to realizing its plan to build a power plant \nwith an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture.\n\"We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori \nprefecture today in line with last November's announcement,\" Tatsuro Seguchi, \npresident of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news \nconference. \"We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and \nstart operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest \npriorities,\" he said.    03/28/2001  Reuters English News Service   (C) \nReuters Limited 2001.\n\n\nWELCOME\nNew Hires\nEGM  - Lyelle Bellard, Damian Nelson, Edward Soo, Jonathan Whitehead\nEIM   - Elsa Aguilar, Melia Dickson, John Hark, Phaedra Jones, Maricar Jose, \nIan McCrory, Mirella Bertrone, Roland Holub, Arthur Miller, Miriam Watson, \n           Richard Albert, Randy Biagini, Thomas Duchnicki, Diego Tabbachino\nENA  - Mitra Mujica, Karen Phillips, Sarah Domonoskie, Kelly Donlevy-Lee\n\nTransfers (to or within) \nENA - John Moore, Mitchell Robinson, Larry Valderrama, Holden Salisbury, \nGrace Rodriguez, Mary Martinez, Dominic Carolan, Kari Oquinn, Katherine \nKelly,    David Fuller, Anguel Grigorov, Oren Zimmerman, Chuanli Deng, Glenn \nSurowiec, Tharsilla Broussard, Geynille Dillingham, Philip Conn, Lola \nWeller,   Christina Brandli, Noemi Camacho, Randel Young, Ina Rangel\nEGM - Shelia Benke, Homer Lin, William McKone, William Berkeland, Valarie \nCurry, Tomas Tellez\nEIM - Allen Ueckert, John W.

However, everyone should note that the \ncredit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk \nare inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a \nreminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses \nRisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key \nproblems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made \nby risk management groups.\n\ndifferences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many \nof your ba's don't. \nwhen a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be \nofficialized\nmarket risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market \nrisk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we \nmake money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.\n\nhow the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk\nMarket risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized \nit does not pick the book up.\nCredit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it \npicks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are \nmoved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the \nprevious day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer \nused, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit \nwill pick up 0 on a go forward basis.\nMarket risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.\nCredit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the \ncounterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names \nneed to be used so they flow properly to credit.\n\nwhat are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data\nAs referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions \nnot being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.\nAs a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names \nare used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first \nday it has 0 positions.\n\nIf you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at \nX35856. \n\n\n"}

{"text": "To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron \nAmerica\u0001,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we \nhave decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit \ntarget associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of \ncreating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, \nwith any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are \nallocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. \n\nThe previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year \nwill remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. \nTherefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the \ncapital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be \nmaintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership \nPolicy outlined below.\n\nThe cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will \nbe set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC \nprocess for transactions which will continue unchanged.\n\nCapital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge \nat the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured \noff credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred \ncost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. \nTransactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be \npriced based upon the financial impact on Enron America\u0001,s overall credit \ncapacity.\n\nOn transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital \nBook will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the \nCredit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used \nspecifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted \nabove, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out \nto the origination and trading groups at actual cost.\n\nBy sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America\u0001,s \nsources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the \norganization. \n\nQuestions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:\nJoe Deffner  853-7117\nAlan Quaintance 345-7731"}

{"text": "Hotwanger,\n\nUnemployment is not something to be taken lightly. With the right approach, it can be a richly \nfulfilling experience. The wrong approach can leave you unsatisfied and disenchanted.\nOr dissatisfied and unenchanted. Whatever. There is a bit of a science involved.\nA few tips:\n\tIf you are living with someone...which you are...it is important that she not wake you\nup when she is on her way to work, as you likely have nowhere to go at that hour anyway. \nTell her to blow dry her hair in the car or don't bother. If she wants you to do something to help\nher out, like make breakfast, pour a bowl of cereal the night before and put it in the fridge. If\nshe gets bored with that, put it in the freezer for an icy treat.\n\tWaking up mid-afternoon may make it difficult for you to get to sleep at a decent\nhour, and your sleep cycle may become so offset that you are actually never awake when \nTara is. That will likely become a sticking point. Drinking during the afternoon will put you in\na drowsy state of mind come nightfall, and you can ensure a regular 14 hrs of slumber.\n\tThere are things to do in a new city, but they are overrated. TV can and will provide\nwhatever culture you think you need. Go outside only for beer or fast food. \n\tAt some point, there may be pressure on you to \"look for a job.\" That is an overly\nvague request. You are likely developing and formulating a career direction with your time \noff, and a job would take away from this \"me\" time and set you back months.\n\tI took a run at unemployment last year, but with the added wrinkle of no TV. That\nis a challenge I wouldn't recommend on your first attempt. Removing you from even a\npremium cable package would be akin to taking a polio sufferer out of an iron lung.\n\tMalt liquor + taco bell Frito burrito = projectile diarrhea.\n\nThat's it for now. I have to get to a meeting. Give me some feedback on how things shake\nout.

Every Summer.\n \nKidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.\n \nIn 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.\n \nKidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.\n \nWe are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   \n\n\nEnron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. \n\nThis year, camp will be May 29-August 10.

Each camp week is Monday through Friday. \n\nThe cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.

One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. \n\nTo this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.

With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the \"Leading Company in the World.\"\n\nAll employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18.

{"text": "BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nEnron Industrial Markets\nEnron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a \nnew 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for \ndelivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the \nover-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron\u0001,s Internet-based \ntransaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first \ntransaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber \nbuyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed \nprice transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in \nthe lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product \nprovides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. \nAdditionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron\u0001,s \nincreasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized \nexpertise in financial risk management.\n\nIn addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the \nQuebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest \nProducts Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled \nnewsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill \nnow positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North \nAmerica. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers \nStadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local \ncommunity in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of \nthe St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to \nthe village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. \n\nEnron Freight Markets\nIn March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, \nInc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM \nalso started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its \nfirst month.\n\nEast Power Origination\nOn Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the \nMidway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt \npeaking power plant.

{"text": "To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron \nAmerica\u0001,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we \nhave decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit \ntarget associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of \ncreating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, \nwith any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are \nallocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. \n\nThe previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year \nwill remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. \nTherefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the \ncapital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be \nmaintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership \nPolicy outlined below.\n\nThe cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will \nbe set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC \nprocess for transactions which will continue unchanged.\n\nCapital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge \nat the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured \noff credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred \ncost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. \nTransactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be \npriced based upon the financial impact on Enron America\u0001,s overall credit \ncapacity.\n\nOn transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital \nBook will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the \nCredit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used \nspecifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted \nabove, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out \nto the origination and trading groups at actual cost.\n\nBy sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America\u0001,s \nsources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the \norganization. \n\nQuestions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:\nJoe Deffner  853-7117\nAlan Quaintance 345-7731"}

{"text": "Hi Jay,\nI thought I'd send you some lite reading.  May provide a distraction for you\nfrom your normal day.  This is a first hand account I received from Capt\nGreider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be\ninterested in, but at least it is the true story and account.  Suprisingly\nnot a whole lot different than the media reported.  The ROC vs PROC point\nwas interesting.  Shows the thought process of an insecure government.\nAnyway enjoy.\nDad\n\nAN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION\nApril 12, 2001\nBy Captain Guy Greider\nContinental Airlines\nSince the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.  Navy EP-3\nsurveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with\nmild interest.  This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I\nnever dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched\ninternational drama.\nSomewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese\nGovernments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to\nretrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call\nwas made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas.\nContinental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch\nthis kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took\nshape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes\nin a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State\nDepartment.\nOn Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph\nFreeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told\nme that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue\nmission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without\nhesitation.\nLater we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case\nthe Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were\nunder the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the\nnegotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an\napology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental\ncrew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our\nbags were packed and waiting by the door.\nOn Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to\nsay that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S.\ncrew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing\nsheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight.\nWe would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air\nForce specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and\ncommunications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the\nairplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.\nThe 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows\nof seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know\nthe condition of the\n24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They\nwere prepared.\nWhen our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to\nfly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight\ntime involved.\nThey were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried\n5 very experienced Flight Attendants.\nThey were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and\nBeverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo.\nOur load planner was Mike Torres.\nAt about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no\nearlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire\nexchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We\nestimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in\nHaikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam)\nSome of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s\ninvitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge\nat the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest\nwith our much-anticipated mission so near.\nBy 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather,\nflight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight.\nAgain, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at\nprecisely 2:15 AM.\nThe stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to\nthe airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation\ndatabase of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain\naccess to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is\nnot in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried\nsophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government\nofficials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight.\nThe route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines\nalong the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly\ntoward Hong Kong.\nThis routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace,\nsomething that the Chinese could consider offensive.\nApproaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control.\nAfter establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut\nto expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable\ndistance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing\nour airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The\ninstant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of\nthe plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan.\nWe told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our\nairspeed.\nWe were still on schedule.\nNow we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island.\nCaptain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast\nwith 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS\napproach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many\nother airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an\n11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We\ntouched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to\nilluminate the sky.\nThe local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was\nbeside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the\nairport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut\ndown the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and\nvehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were\nbrought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door.\nThe Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of\ntheir communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were\nalso briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case\nthe Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard\nwas an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the\ntranslator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to\nhave everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents.\nHe collected all of our passports and left the aircraft.\nBefore he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to\ndeplane.\nPeter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and\nservicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the\nwalk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a\nchance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed\nbetween people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft\nand the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and\ndeparture live.\nOnce the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around\nfor any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could\nhappen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who\nwas on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and\ndemanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General\nsaid that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the\ngeneral declaration, which is standard on all international flights had\nlisted the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for\nRepublic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over\nthis.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the\nPeoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them.\nWith the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete,\n2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they\nbolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last\none was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were\nwithdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed.\nIt was my turn at the controls.\nOnce airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the\nbright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over\ninternational waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from\nthe back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch\nover the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He\nwanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft\nCommander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The\nAmbassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and\nthe entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how\nproud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving\nthe lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they\nhad been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job.\nAfter his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the\ncockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had\nhappened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8\nChinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot\nmade 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the\nintercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on\nthe EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at\nthe time.\nThe fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane\nrolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to\nlose altitude.\nThe Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the\nnose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone\ndeparted the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on\nthe right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3\ndepressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating\nairspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the\nforward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and\nwrapped around the tail.\nWe were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The\ndive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000\nfeet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching\nthe aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was\ncertain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan\nIsland.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives.\nThey made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally\nrecognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow,\nthey managed to get the airplane on the ground.\nTheir next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic\nsurveillance equipment aboard the EP-3.\nMeanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and\nwere yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days\nwould be a very uncertain time for them.\nWhen we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated.\nTheir food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese\nrestaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some\ncoffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided.\nThe crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their\nreturn home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner\nfrom the United States.\nThe rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful.\nDuring the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and\nenjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing\nat Anderson AFB was carried live on national television.\nWe taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out\nto welcome all of us home."}

Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at\n\"state sponsorship,\" implying the complicity of one or more foreign\ngovernments. In the words of former National Security Adviser, Lawrence\nEagleburger, \"I think we will show when we get attacked like this, we are\nterrible in our strength and in our retribution.\"\nMeanwhile, parroting official statements, the Western media mantra has\napproved the launching of \"punitive actions\" directed against civilian\ntargets in the Middle East. In the words of William Saffire writing in the\nNew York Times: \"When we reasonably determine our attackers' bases and\ncamps, we must pulverize them-minimizing but accepting the risk of\ncollateral damage-and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terror's\nnational hosts\".\nThe following text outlines the history of Ousmane Bin Laden and the links\nof the Islamic \"Jihad\" to the formulation of US foreign policy during the\nCold War and its aftermath.\n\n*                  *                   *\n\nPrime suspect in the New York and Washington terrorists attacks, branded by\nthe FBI as an \"international terrorist\" for his role in the African US\nembassy bombings, Saudi born Ousmane bin Laden was recruited during the\nSoviet-Afghan war \"ironically under the auspices of the CIA, to fight\nSoviet invaders\". 1\nIn 1979 \"the largest covert operation in the history of the CIA\"  was\nlaunched in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in support of\nthe pro-Communist government of Babrak Kamal.2:\n\"With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistan's ISI [Inter\nServices Intelligence], who wanted to turn the Afghan jihad into a global\nwar waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union, some 35,000 Muslim\nradicals from 40 Islamic countries joined Afghanistan's fight between 1982\nand 1992. Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs.\nEventually more than 100,000 foreign Muslim radicals were directly\ninfluenced by the Afghan jihad.\"3\nThe Islamic \"jihad\" was supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia\nwith a significant part of the funding generated from the Golden Crescent\ndrug trade:\n\"In March 1985, President Reagan signed National Security Decision\nDirective 166,...[which] authorize[d] stepped-up covert military aid to the\nmujahideen, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to\ndefeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a\nSoviet withdrawal. The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic\nincrease in arms supplies-a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987,\n... as well as a \"ceaseless stream\" of CIA and Pentagon specialists who\ntraveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan's ISI on the main road near\nRawalpindi, Pakistan. There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani\nintelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels.\"4\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) using Pakistan's military\nInter-Services Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in training the\nMujahideen. In turn, the CIA sponsored guerrilla training was integrated\nwith the teachings of Islam:\n\"Predominant themes were that Islam was a complete socio-political\nideology, that holy Islam was being violated by the atheistic Soviet\ntroops, and that the Islamic people of Afghanistan should reassert their\nindependence by overthrowing the leftist Afghan regime propped up by\nMoscow.\"5\nPAKISTAN'S INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS\nPakistan's ISI was used as a \"go-between\". The CIA covert support to the\n\"jihad\" operated indirectly through the Pakistani ISI, --i.e. the CIA did\nnot channel its support directly to the Mujahideen. In other words, for\nthese covert operations to be \"successful\", Washington was careful not to\nreveal the ultimate objective of the \"jihad\", which consisted in destroying\nthe Soviet Union.\nIn the words of CIA's Milton Beardman \"We didn't train Arabs\". Yet\naccording to Abdel Monam Saidali, of the Al-aram Center for Strategic\nStudies in Cairo, bin Laden and the \"Afghan Arabs\" had been imparted \"with\nvery sophisticated types of training that was allowed to them by the CIA\" 6\nCIA's Beardman confirmed, in this regard, that Ousmane bin Laden was not\naware of the role he was playing on behalf of Washington. In the words of\nbin Laden (quoted by Beardman): \"neither I, nor my brothers saw evidence of\nAmerican help\". 7\nMotivated by nationalism and religious fervor, the Islamic warriors were\nunaware that they were fighting the Soviet Army on behalf of Uncle Sam.\n While there were contacts at the upper levels of the intelligence\nhierarchy, Islamic rebel leaders in theatre had no contacts with Washington\nor the CIA.\nWith CIA backing and the funneling of massive amounts of US military aid,\nthe Pakistani ISI had developed into a \"parallel structure wielding\nenormous power over all aspects of government\". 8 The ISI had a staff\ncomposed of military and intelligence officers, bureaucrats, undercover\nagents and informers, estimated at 150,000. 9\nMeanwhile, CIA operations had also reinforced the Pakistani military regime\nled by General Zia Ul Haq:\n\"\"Relations between the CIA and the ISI [Pakistan's military intelligence]\nhad grown increasingly warm following [General] Zia's ouster of Bhutto and\nthe advent of the military regime,'... During most of the Afghan war,\nPakistan was more aggressively anti-Soviet than even the United States.\n Soon after the Soviet military invaded Afghanistan in 1980, Zia [ul Haq]\nsent his ISI chief to destabilize the Soviet Central Asian states. The CIA\nonly agreed to this plan in October 1984.... 'the CIA was more cautious\nthan the Pakistanis.' Both Pakistan and the United States took the line of\ndeception on Afghanistan with a public posture of negotiating a settlement\nwhile privately agreeing that military escalation was the best course.\"10\nTHE GOLDEN CRESCENT DRUG TRIANGLE\nThe history of the drug trade in Central Asia is intimately related to the\nCIA's covert operations. Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war, opium production\nin Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets. There\nwas no local production of heroin. 11 In this regard, Alfred McCoy's study\nconfirms that within two years of the onslaught of the CIA operation in\nAfghanistan, \"the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands became the world's top\nheroin producer, supplying 60 percent of U.S. demand. In Pakistan, the\nheroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979... to 1.2 million by\n1985 -- a much steeper rise than in any other nation\":12\n\"CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade. As the Mujahideen\nguerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan, they ordered peasants to\nplant opium as a revolutionary tax. Across the border in Pakistan, Afghan\nleaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence\noperated hundreds of heroin laboratories. During this decade of wide-open\ndrug-dealing, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to\ninstigate major seizures or arrests ... U.S. officials had refused to\ninvestigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies 'because U.S.\n narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the war against\nSoviet influence there.' In 1995, the former CIA director of the Afghan\noperation, Charles Cogan, admitted the CIA had indeed sacrificed the drug\nwar to fight the Cold War. 'Our main mission was to do as much damage as\npossible to the Soviets. We didn't really have the resources or the time to\ndevote to an investigation of the drug trade,'... 'I don't think that we\nneed to apologize for this. Every situation has its fallout.... There was\nfallout in terms of drugs, yes. But the main objective was accomplished.\nThe Soviets left Afghanistan.'\"13\nIN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR\n\\In the wake of the Cold War, the Central Asian region is not only\nstrategic for its extensive oil reserves, it also produces three quarters\nof the World's opium representing multibillion dollar revenues to business\nsyndicates, financial institutions, intelligence agencies and organized\ncrime. The annual proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade (between 100\nand 200 billion dollars) represents approximately one third of the\nWorldwide annual turnover of narcotics, estimated by the United Nations to\nbe of the order of $500 billion.14\nWith the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a new surge in opium\nproduction has unfolded. (According to UN estimates, the production of\nopium in Afghanistan in 1998-99 -- coinciding with the build up of armed\ninsurgencies in the former Soviet republics-reached a record high of 4600\nmetric tons.15 Powerful business syndicates in the former Soviet Union\nallied with organized crime are competing for the strategic control over\nthe heroin routes.\nThe ISI's extensive intelligence military-network was not dismantled in the\nwake of the Cold War. The CIA continued to support the Islamic \"jihad\" out\nof Pakistan. New undercover initiatives were set in motion in Central Asia,\nthe Caucasus and the Balkans. Pakistan's military and intelligence\napparatus essentially \"served as a catalyst for the disintegration of the\nSoviet Union and the emergence of six new Muslim republics in Central\nAsia.\" 16.\nMeanwhile, Islamic missionaries of the Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia had\nestablished themselves in the Muslim republics as well as within the\nRussian federation encroaching upon the institutions of the secular State.\n Despite its anti-American ideology, Islamic fundamentalism was largely\nserving Washington's strategic interests in the former Soviet Union.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the civil war in\nAfghanistan continued unabated. The Taliban were being supported by the\nPakistani Deobandis and their political party the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam\n(JUI). In 1993, JUI entered the government coalition of Prime Minister\nBenazzir Bhutto. Ties between JUI, the Army and ISI were established. In\n1995, with the downfall of the Hezb-I-Islami Hektmatyar government in\nKabul, the Taliban not only instated a hardline Islamic government, they\nalso \"handed control of training camps in Afghanistan over to JUI\nfactions...\" 17\nAnd the JUI with the support of the Saudi Wahhabi movements played a key\nrole in recruiting volunteers to fight in the Balkans and the former Soviet\nUnion.\nJane Defense Weekly confirms in this regard that \"half of Taliban manpower\nand equipment originate[d] in Pakistan under the ISI\" 18 In fact, it would\nappear that following the Soviet withdrawal both sides in the Afghan civil\nwar continued to receive covert support through Pakistan's ISI. 19\nIn other words, backed by Pakistan's military intelligence (ISI) which in\nturn was controlled by the CIA, the Taliban Islamic State was largely\nserving American geopolitical interests. The Golden Crescent drug trade was\nalso being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army (starting in\nthe early 1990s) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In last few months\nthere is evidence that Mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of\nKLA-NLA terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia.\nNo doubt, this explains why Washington has closed its eyes on the reign of\nterror imposed by the Taliban including the blatant derogation of women's\nrights, the closing down of schools for girls, the dismissal of women\nemployees from government offices and the enforcement of \"the Sharia laws\nof punishment\".20\nTHE WAR IN CHECHNYA\nWith regard to Chechnya, the main rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Al\nKhattab were trained and indoctrinated in CIA sponsored camps in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan. According to Yossef Bodansky, director of the\nU.S. Congress's Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, the war\nin Chechnya had been planned during a secret summit of HizbAllah\nInternational held in 1996 in Mogadishu, Somalia. 21 The summit, was\nattended by Osama bin Laden and high-ranking Iranian and Pakistani\nintelligence officers. In this regard, the involvement of Pakistan's ISI in\nChechnya \"goes far beyond supplying the Chechens with weapons and\nexpertise: the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually calling the\nshots in this war\". 22\nRussia's main pipeline route transits through Chechnya and Dagestan.\n Despite Washington's perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism, the\nindirect beneficiaries of the Chechen war are the Anglo-American oil\nconglomerates which are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline\ncorridors out of the Caspian Sea basin.\nThe two main Chechen rebel armies (respectively led by Commander Shamil\nBasayev and Emir Khattab) estimated at 35,000 strong were supported by\nPakistan's ISI, which also played a key role in organizing and training the\nChechen rebel army:\n\"[In 1994] the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence arranged for Basayev\nand his trusted lieutenants to undergo intensive Islamic indoctrination and\ntraining in guerrilla warfare in the Khost province of Afghanistan at Amir\nMuawia camp, set up in the early 1980s by the CIA and ISI and run by famous\nAfghani warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In July 1994, upon graduating from\nAmir Muawia, Basayev was transferred to Markaz-i-Dawar camp in Pakistan to\nundergo training in advanced guerrilla tactics. In Pakistan, Basayev met\nthe highest ranking Pakistani military and intelligence officers: Minister\nof Defense General Aftab Shahban Mirani, Minister of Interior General\nNaserullah Babar, and the head of the ISI branch in charge of supporting\nIslamic causes, General Javed Ashraf, (all now retired). High-level\nconnections soon proved very useful to Basayev.23\nFollowing his training and indoctrination stint, Basayev was assigned to\nlead the assault against Russian federal troops in the first Chechen war in\n1995. His organization had also developed extensive links to criminal\nsyndicates in Moscow as well as ties to Albanian organized crime and the\nKosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In 1997-98, according to Russia's Federal\nSecurity Service (FSB) \"Chechen warlords started buying up real estate in\nKosovo... through several real estate firms registered as a cover in\nYugoslavia\" 24\nBasayev's organisation has also been involved in a number of rackets\nincluding narcotics, illegal tapping and sabotage of Russia's oil\npipelines, kidnapping, prostitution, trade in counterfeit dollars and the\nsmuggling of nuclear materials (See Mafia linked to Albania's collapsed\npyramids, 25 Alongside the extensive laundering of drug money, the proceeds\nof various illicit activities have been funneled towards the recruitment of\nmercenaries and the purchase of weapons.\nDuring his training in Afghanistan, Shamil Basayev linked up with Saudi\nborn veteran Mujahideen Commander \"Al Khattab\" who had fought as a\nvolunteer in Afghanistan. Barely a few months after Basayev's return to\nGrozny, Khattab was invited (early 1995) to set up an army base in Chechnya\nfor the training of Mujahideen fighters. According to the BBC, Khattab's\nposting to Chechnya had been \"arranged through the Saudi-Arabian based\n[International] Islamic Relief Organisation, a militant religious\norganisation, funded by mosques and rich individuals which channeled funds\ninto Chechnya\".26\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nSince the Cold War era, Washington has consciously supported Ousmane bin\nLaden, while at same time placing him on the FBI's \"most wanted list\" as\nthe World's foremost terrorist.\nWhile the Mujahideen are busy fighting America's war in the Balkans and the\nformer Soviet Union, the FBI-operating as a US based Police Force- is\nwaging a domestic war against terrorism, operating in some respects\nindependently of the CIA which has-since the Soviet-Afghan war-supported\ninternational terrorism through its covert operations.\nIn a cruel irony, while the Islamic jihad-featured by the Bush\nAdminstration as \"a threat to America\"-is blamed for the terrorist assaults\non the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, these same Islamic\norganisations constitute a key instrument of US military-intelligence\noperations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union.\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the truth\nmust prevail to prevent the Bush Adminstration together with its NATO\npartners from embarking upon a military adventure which threatens the\nfuture of humanity.\n\nENDNOTES\nHugh Davies, International: 'Informers' point the finger at bin Laden;\nWashington on alert for suicide bombers, The Daily Telegraph, London, 24\nAugust 1998.\nSee Fred Halliday, \"The Un-great game: the Country that lost the Cold War,\nAfghanistan, New Republic, 25 March 1996):\nAhmed Rashid, The Taliban: Exporting Extremism, Foreign Affairs,\nNovember-December 1999.\nSteve Coll, Washington Post, July 19, 1992.\nDilip Hiro, Fallout from the Afghan Jihad, Inter Press Services, 21\nNovember 1995.\nWeekend Sunday (NPR); Eric Weiner, Ted Clark; 16 August 1998.\nIbid.\nDipankar Banerjee; Possible Connection of ISI With Drug Industry, India\nAbroad, 2 December 1994.\nIbid\nSee Diego Cordovez and Selig Harrison, Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story\nof the Soviet Withdrawal, Oxford university Press, New York, 1995.

But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering. \nYou monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard. \nWhat lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our WorldTradeCenter, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed. \nDid you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. \nDid you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. \nDid you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together. \nLet me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God. \nSome people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals. \nIN PAIN \nYes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United Statesand, probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before. \nBut there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice. \nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future. \nIn the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined. \nTHE STEEL IN US \nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. \nAs Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish. \nSo I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just started. \nBut you're about to learn.\nSabrina Pyke\nAWC, Incorporated\nIntegrated Supply Division\n(713) 944-2100sabrina.pyke@awc-inc.com \n "}

{"text": "A colleague has sent you this article from Fortune (http://www.fortune.com ).\nReply to your colleague at beth.cherry@enform.com \n \n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nWHILE YOU WERE OUT\nReal Jobs for Unreal People\nThings to do after the before.\nStanley Bing\nMon Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2001\nWith the collapse of the new economy, a host of formerly employed people  are now formerly employed. Having developed their skills in the nouveau  operating environment, these ex-operators are now roaming the  brick-and-mortar business establishments of the nation and the world,  looking for ways to transfer their digital abilities to analog  assignments. \nUnfortunately, the capabilities that were valued in the halcyon days of  derring-do and flimflammery don't automatically translate to our current  situation. Yet those in the digital diaspora have enormous gifts that  took them to the top of their now defunct professions! Many are young  and good-looking. All they need, as a group, is a little help turning  the things they know into jobs that actually need to be done. As a  public service, then, let's look at some now dysfunctional functions and  how they may be morphed into lucrative gigs in the global here and now. \nBefore: Web designer. Back when the Internet was cooking, there  were many, many jobs for people who designed the product. There were  sites dedicated to delivering Chinese food to your house if you wanted  it, free of charge. Others would provide you with information about  classmates you had no use for 20 years ago, free of charge. There were  online phone books, in case you had lost yours. And every site needed  designers to make all the little boxes that said things like OKAY and NO  THANKS. \nAfter: tattoo artist. Many of the people who were dedicated to  the Internet economy now seem to have tattoos, and need people to design  and draw them. Although this work doesn't pay as much as Web design, its  product lasts longer. Best of all, any stock options you receive are  likely to be worth about as much as those you got in your old job. \nBefore: vice president, dot-com sales and marketing. Internet  companies needed more positioning than a heifer in heat. The people in  charge of this process had to know how to take the concept of the new  company, slice it up into tiny pieces, and serve it to advertisers and  consumers. \nAfter: meat handler. A cow is likewise inedible until it is cut  up into digestible pieces and cooked. It takes only a little study and a  slightly stronger stomach to make the transition to this sector of the  service economy. \nBefore: dot-com investment banker. Trillions were raised by jolly  salespeople able to persuade otherwise conservative investors to pony up  vast sums on little more than vapors. Some of the ideas seem rather  foolish now, and the valuations placed on these companies  appear...optimistic? Recently one smart company wrote down investments  that are now worth some $48 billion less than they were a few years ago.  This is a testament to the power that messianic investment bankers  infused into the market. Shall that talent go to waste? \nAfter: shaman, Pulau Tiga, Malaysia. Not at all. The power of the  shaman lies in the faith he or she is able to produce in the village.  Shamans are looking for folks who believe in them implicitly because of  their ability with words and their impressive makeup and feathers. \nBefore: tech sector stockbroker. In many ways, the stockbroker  was the most important player of all, once the initial money had been  raised. For while many who were involved in new-economy enterprises  believed that the product on the screen was their raison d'etre, the  real activity of the average dot-com was selling securities. The fact  that these entities were being merchandised without benefit of business  plan, cash flow, or even, much of the time, common sense only makes the  achievement of these professionals more admirable. \nAfter: ice salesman, Alaska. Around the globe, people want to buy  stuff simply because it is offered to them. Does anyone really need hot  dogs that plump when you cook them? Sneakers whose heels light up when  you walk? Wine that costs $400 a bottle? A car the size of a hotel room?  Cheese puffs? The genius of our system is that it creates opportunities  for those with the gift for making others part with their money happily,  simply for the pleasure of exercising the right to spend. Nobody is  better prepared to shoulder that burden. \nBefore: new-media journalist. None of this would have been  possible without the staunch efforts of the journalist pundits who  prognosticated until they could prognosticate no more. The Internet was  going to replace radio, television, human speech, the microwave, sex,  drugs, and the music business. To date, it has replaced nothing but  itself. \nAfter: high school cheerleader. They leap! They dance! They know  which team they're on. True, standards for physical attractiveness and  fitness will have to be relaxed when these members of the fourth estate  run onto the playing field, but that's a fair trade for the verve that  they will bring to any assignment. \nBefore: president and chief operating officer. This was a big  title. But the wired operating chief mostly had the job of running  around and making sure everybody got what he needed. There was little  glamour. There was a lot of worrying and aggravation as the boss lurched  around in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole trying to beat all the  challenges back with a stick. And it was the prez who was the first to  see that the conceptual emperor was walking around with nothing but his  prospectus in his hand. \nAfter: fast-food chef. How much more fun will this job be! Food  is something you can touch, smell, and, obviously, taste. No doubt the  pressure at mealtime can get intense, but it's nothing next to the heat  felt when the 30-year-old CFO announced the company was down to its last  $30 million. \nBefore: chairman and CEO, big dotcom.com. The chairman, on the  other hand, was about as important to the dot-com nation as Mount  Rushmore is to the governance of the U.S. It's nice that it's there. It  lends to the majesty of everything. Big face? Sure. But function? No. \nAfter: bathrobe model. They have styles so nice these days that  you can greet visitors in them and they won't know you just woke up.  After a few years at this challenging assignment, you can graduate to  being a management consultant. \nBefore: workout specialist. When it was all over, these folks  came in to mop up the broken glass, reblow it, and heave it out there  for another round. The workout job is a painful one but as cleansing and  necessary a part of the process as any other. Now that the workouts are  all but over, however, these gifted specialists are at liberty and  looking for apt employment. \nAfter: proctologist. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do  it. \n http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&doc_id=203860 \nColleague at Fortunehttp://www.fortune.com "}
