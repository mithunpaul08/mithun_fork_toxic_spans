I wanted to follow-up with you in regards to the email I sent last week.  Are you currently working on a wireless initiative for gMoney?  If not, perhaps you could direct me to the group that is?

I would be very interested in speaking to someone regarding mobilizing your online financial management applications to wireless devices, and hope to hear from you soon.

Kind Regards,

Laura

Greetings Eric,

I was interested in knowing if you had plans to mobilize the content and transactional capabilities of the gMoney.com online financial management tool to wireless devices?

I am with AvocadoIT, a software and services provider that can enable existing HTML, XML or database content to a number of post-pc devices including smart phones, PDAs, two-way pagers, inter-active TV and even regular voice telephones.   AvocadoIT has a proven solution that enables you to get up and running on the wireless web and the voice web in a short amount of time, with minimal IT resources, and no re-programming.  

You'll see from our client list (http://www.avocadoit.digitalenterprises.com/customers/customers.html) that we are working with leaders in a broad range of industries, including a number of financial sites such as E*Trade, Fidelity Canada, and PayTrust.

We are a fully-funded pre-IPO company with partners such as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, Sybase and many more.  We recently completed a very successful Series C funding of $70M and are primed to be the leaders in our wireless space.

I'd love to be able to connect with someone at gMoney.com who is working on a wireless initiative and would welcome an opportunity to demonstrate our technology to your team.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,

Laura

AVOCADOIT FORMS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH 

CAP GEMINI ERNST & YOUNG TO TARGET ENTERPRISES FOCUSED ON MOBILE SOLUTIONS


SAN JOSE, CA and NEW YORK, NY \u2013 December 4, 2000 \u2013 AvocadoIT is augmenting its position in the wireless market still further by partnering with professional services giant, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young U.S. LLC (CGE&Y). The two companies have joined forces to develop a solution for companies that are focused on mobile solutions.\u00a0Having already earned a highly coveted reputation as a premier wireless enabler, AvocadoIT now takes a significant step with a strategic alliance with CGE&Y, one of the world's largest consulting firms. CGE&Y's global presence will create a gateway to the world's leading companies for AvocadoIT to enhance its market presence and make possible a greater reach into the enterprise applications marketplace. 


\"Mobile solutions should be a strategic consideration that touches everyone from a company's board of directors to the business line managers,\" explained David Chan, AvocadoIT's vice president of business development. \"A total wireless solution takes more than just the tools and the methodology, the components at which AvocadoIT excels.\u00a0A comprehensive wireless solution also takes an understanding of the individual company's needs and mission, and that's the implementation modality that Cap Gemini Ernst & Young supplies through its superior consulting services.\" 


Cap Gemini Ernst & Young will build a dedicated mobile consulting team leveraging AvocadoIT\u2019s technology. AvocadoIT will provide the platform, featuring its patent-pending Intelligent RenderingTM process that connects corporate users to their business-critical and time-sensitive applications. It allows companies to extend their web content and e-commerce offerings to non-PC devices.\u00a0CGE&Y's solution is intended to enhance AvocadoIT's mobile methodology to enable applications, as well as deliver the customer analysis and business process integration that has been the hallmark of their world-renowned consulting services organization.\u00a0Together, the two companies plan to co-develop new mobile solutions within several industry verticals. 


\u201cCap Gemini Ernst & Young is poised to deliver substantial business value in the wireless marketplace by leveraging AvocadoIT's technology to accelerate the development process,\" said John Distefano, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young's vice president of mobile solutions.\u00a0\"We were looking for a partner with whom we could address the immediate needs of our clients and at the same time provide them with a technology platform to support the anticipated growth and changes of the wireless marketplace.\u00a0Cap Gemini Ernst & Young is currently building a dedicated Mobile Solutions Practice based on AvocadoIT\u2019s technology platform that will drive the rapid deployment of mobile applications to support our clients\u2019 enterprise strategies.\"  


The solution alliance will enable AvocadoIT to mobilize data from numerous sources and formats.\u00a0Enterprise customers that wish to mobilize corporate data for their partners, workforce or clients often store such data in databases, legacy systems, enterprise applications or homegrown systems.\u00a0AvocadoIT believes that the CGE&Y solution will expand AvocadoIT's ability to access and mobilize data that exists in formats beyond HTML or XML.\u00a0This solution is intended to provide customers with reduced risk and rapid time to market advantage that will also allow them to more easily adapt to new standards and technologies. 


The two companies will develop a leading edge mobile solution based on Cap Gemini Ernst & Young\u2019s consulting strengths and AvocadoIT\u2019s mobile expertise. In concert with AvocadoIT, CGE&Y is developing the consulting methodology to match AvocadoIT's technology and tool-set.\u00a0Together, the companies plan to market the mobile solution with an aggressive initiative in several markets.
