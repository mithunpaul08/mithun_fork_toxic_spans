Should you need additional information, feel free to contact us at travel@expedia.com Thank you for choosing Expedia for your travel needs.  Expedia.com Don't just travel.  Travel right. http://expedia.com/ ____________________________________________________________________________ ____  ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S. points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from the carrier.  CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS  NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.  Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S. (including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage. Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not restricted to: 1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death. 2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods, and availability of excess valuation coverage. 3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the air carrier. 4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract. 5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry. 6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air carriers or aircraft and rerouting. You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.  You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.  NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS  Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.  RECONFIRMATION NOTICE Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations. Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.  NOTICE If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.

Any exclusion or limitation of liability of carrier shall apply to and be for the benefit of agents, servants and representatives of carrier and any person whose aircraft is used by carrier for carriage and its agents, servants and representatives. 7. Checked baggage will be delivered to bearer of the baggage check, in case of damage to baggage moving in international transportation complaint must be made in writing to carrier forthwith after discovery of damage and, at the latest, within seven days from receipt; in case of delay, complaint must be made within 21 days from date the baggage was delivered.

As such, I would like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC. Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if needed.  If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at x3-6173.  Regards,  Ben"}
{"text": "i got a room for sept.6th - sept. 9th.  it is the rainman suite at the  mirage.  there are 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a huge living room.  with the  room we get limo service to and from the hotel.  if there are 7 of us paying  it will cost roughly $225 for each of us.  that is pretty cheap.  this way we  don't need to get another room.  i also reseved a room at the luxor that can  sleep 4 and a suite with 1 bedroom and a living room.  this will cost us $200  per night.  tell me which one you prefer.  we also neet to make sure everyone  goes b/c if someone drops out it will cost us a lot more.  merlin, the suite  at the mirage wasn't available for the 13th-16th.  get back to me soon.  you  can email me back or call me at 713-807-1699.  later"}
