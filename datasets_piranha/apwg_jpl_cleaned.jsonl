I am a U.S soldier currently serving with the army of the 3rd Infantry Division. My team is trained for dictating bombs and explosives and would apply caution and diffuse them. I am a widower; I lost my wife 5 years ago in car accident. May her gentle soul rest in peace. She left me with a girl who is 13 years old now, i came in contact with you, because I'm seeking for your friendship, understanding. Currently I'm in Syria with the 3rd Infantry Division. I am writing you about a business idea that will be of great benefit to us. During our raid, in one of the ISLE camp Aleppo, we discovered a huge amount of money, golds, desert diamonds, valued at $559,640,290.00 USD. We do not remit the entire funds to US government. We divided the fund in into two.  We sent one part to US Government, and the other part, we used UN security diplomat to move it to a secure location at the moment.  My wife died in auto crash, in 13 June 2012, when my wife died, I was currently serving in Afghanistan in the military with the army. My annual salary is not up to 30,000 USD annually all the funds go to my daughter's college fund. I engaged in this transaction because I wanted this money to help my life, and give my daughter a good life that she deserves. And establish a good business in good memory of my loving wife. Like buying house with sea view and establishing good business.  The senior officers involved in this deal want to share the funds and the diamonds. According to the sharing mode, I will be receiving cash and valued equivalent of$11,700,000.00 USD.  Right now I am looking for credible person who will be able to assist me to receive my share in cash, in your door step on a special arrangement with UN diplomatic envoy, I am in Syria currently, secondly I can\u2019t use my US account to receive such huge amount of fund or involving anybody i know right now because of security reason, it will arise suspicions on me. I also wish to use my own share in any profitable business which you may introduce to me; I have no experience in business. I decided to seek your consent on this matter because of time constraint. After a lot of thoughts about this I decided to contact you because currently I am still serving in Syria which will make it impossible for me to carry out this transaction in America and also  considering the nature of my job, for security reasons, I will not be able to handle this transaction myself. I decided to contact you hoping that you will find this proposal interesting. The reason why I came to you with this proposal is because we are ready to share the money which is valued at $279,820,145 and according to the sharing agreement 16 army personal are involved, and the fund will be shared according to army ranks in my division. My share $11,700,000.00 USD If you are ready to work with me, I am ready to offer 30% of my total share while I will take 70% of the total fund. Before we proceed in this transaction, I will need your full contact details, is risky free, you have nothing to lose. I will give you any information you will need. I strongly want any government issuer ID card from you. Your Residential/office address I only require your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through.

However, I am Barrister Evans Thomas Attorney to the late Engr.Ronald Johnson, a national of Northern American, who used to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company(SPDC) in Nigeria . On the 11th of November,2008. My client,his wife And their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident, Since then I have made several inquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice that you are the only surviving relation of my client. Otherwise the Estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged.Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about $15 million U.S dollars(Fifteen million U.S.America dollars). Consequently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over several years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15million U.S dollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through and also forward the following to me: Your Full Name: Your House Address: Your Tele-phone And Fax No: Your Age and Gender : Your Nationality: Your Occupation: I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me VIA this my confidential email { richardkc1166@yahoo.com.hk } Yours Faithfully, Barr.

I\u2019m Mrs. Josiane married to Mr. Patrick Zamble. I and my husband works in one of the Ivory Coast reputable Oil Company (TEXACO) where he was the director for twenty years before his death on 13 September 2016. I and my husband were married for eighteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks. Before his death we were both faithful couples. Since his death I decided not to re-marry outside my matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 3.500, 000.00\u20ac (THREE  Million Five Hundred Thousand Euros) deposited in a bank.      Recently, my doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is Pancreatic Cancer, the one that disturbs me most are my legs which are paralyzed. Having known my condition I have decided to donate this fund to you, for the assistance of poor children, widows, single mothers, mosques churches. farmers. and orphanage homes.      I took this decision because I can\u2019t do any investment any longer and I don't have any child that will inherit this money if I die. I don\u2019t want this remaining fund to be used by the vultures.  I know that I\u2018m going to be in the bosom of God and I want you to be prayerful. I'm hospitalized and I will be going for another operation soon, in your reply, I will instruct my bank for the donation fund transfer arrangement and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another individual for this same purpose.

{"text": "Dear child of God, I am writing this mail to you praying that it reach's you in good health, for I myself is in a very critical health condition in which I go to bed every night not sure if I will be alive to see the next day. My name is Mrs. Aleena Faruk from Syria but I am contacting you from a hospital bed. I want to tell you of my ordeal as I am left with no choice but to be open to you. I am married to the late Mr. Usman Faruk who until his death in October 2015 was a Syrian government contractor. We were married for thirteen years without any child until the morning he died. My husband has the sum of eleven million united state dollars, US$11.million. with a bank in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso. As it is now, I am the only person who knows of the existence of this fund and presently, I am in a hospital bed here dying from this cancer which started after our neighborhood was attacked with a chemical atomic gas which left over three hundred people dead including my husband. The government is blaming the rebel fighters for the attack while the rebels are blaming the government fighters for the said attack. I am confuse and do not know who to believe. Now the doctor has made it clear that I no longer respond to medications, indicating that I have only but a short time to live. The cancer is not my main problem but the partial stroke which makes it hard for me to write my mails. Having considered my position, I have decided to use you to carry out my plan. I will guide you to receive the eleven million dollars and you will take 30% of it for yourself and your family while you will take the remaining 70% and build an orphanage home for the motherless children in your location or anywhere of your choice because I am an orphan and does not have any relative. This has been my wish before this sickness came between my plans. Please you must follow this directive or I will look for another person. I would have given this task to someone in this country but I have sworn with the death of my beloved husband that Syria will know no peace. However, if you are not capable of handling this task or do not have confidence in this message, quickly delete the message and forget about it, but if you have confidence in it and can handle the task then kindly indicate by responding. I will be waiting to hear from you. Note that you might receive this message in your inbox or spam or junk folder depends on your web host or server network.  Thanks and regards. Mrs. Aleena Faruk.

I have recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and a rare heart disease which has defiled all medical treatment. Expert diagnosis has shown that I have few months to live. I am worth $41.7 Billion US Dollars which I inherited from my late husband Mr. John T. Walton which rates me as the second richest woman in the world. The intention of this email is to employ the expertise of a Charity minded individual, who can identify a viable and guarantee reasonable distribution of my wealth to the needy. I cannot rely on family and closest relatives anymore, as they did not show responsible behavior when I entrusted part of my wealth to them to distribute to charitable organizations but instead they used the money for their personal needs. To prevent any more mishaps, my attorney will act as a check, monitoring every aspect of the Charity. My will is with my Lawyer which my family is fully aware about, but there is 5% of my Bank worth which is $2,085000000.00 (Two Billion, Eighty Five Million U.S Dollars) which nobody is aware of except my attorney.

No sane country will allow it's self to be militarily  threathened in such a way.  The loss of Crimea is fully the responsibility  of the Ukranian opposition. The  way they behaved in 2004-10  in trying to limit Russia's  access  to  the naval  bases and  limiting  the use of their ships didn't leave much of a  confidence considering the crap  they pulled in Feb. Sigining an agreement and then ignoring it in less than 24 hours. Do  you think  Russian national security should be left  to the  whim of such people? People who's first act was to ban the Russian  language. What's to say their second  act wouldn't be to unilaterly  revoke the Crimean base agreement? Merkel was the voice of sanity in 2008 when Bush  and eastern european neo-cons wanted to extend  NATO's border to  Russia. To precisely  avoid a  situation like this. I don't know what happened to her, she should have known better. Hell the US government should have  known better. There are cables in Wikileaks warning of this exact situation.

{"text": " From: Mr. Marc Smith Group Finance Director. LLoyds Banking Group United Kingdom. Greetings To You !!!!! Firstly, I am Mr. Marc Smith, the Group Finance Director of Lloyds Banking Group United Kingdom. I am contacting you for a legitimate business transaction strictly for you and me alone. I personally discovered a dormant account with a total sum of USD$95,000,000.00 (NINETY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) here in our bank. The owner of this dormant account died on 4th Jan 2007. Since his death, nobody has operated in his account because the account has NO BENEFICIARY attached to it. According to our BANKING CODE OF ETHICS and decision imposed by the new British Prime Minister David Cameron; this dormant fund will be confiscated by law and will be diverted to the British Treasury as Unclaimed fund if it remains dormant for a period of [11] Eleven years without any claim.

{"text": "Dear Friend, I Am Henry James the Manager, Bills and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance department in a Bank. Actually, I have a very urgent & confidential Business Proposition for you & for our overall mutual interest. On the 6th of March 2001, our Customer, an American National, late Williams J. Stone, an Oil Merchant / Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, deposited, a valued amount of US$32Million in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder, & finally we discovered from his contract employers NNPC, that late William J. Stone, until his death Twelve years ago in a ghastly terrorist attack to American Airlines Flight 11, from Boston, Massachusetts, to Los Angeles, California, crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center (WTC) with 86 people on board. All occupants of the Airplane unfortunately lost their lives. On further Investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his Next of kin were Fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that late Williams J. Stone, did not declare any Next of kin in all his official documents. This sum US$32Million is still floating in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Laws, at the expiration of 15years, the money will revert to the Ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as a Next of kin of Late Williams J. Stone. This is simple. All I require is your honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I will want you to send to me on your return email the following information for the transfer in your favor. 1. Your full names as the Beneficiary of the Fund. 2. Your contact address. 3. Your private phone and fax numbers. Let's consider that our ratio of sharing will be as stated Thus; 1. I as the Originator of the Fund will take 50% of the transferable Fund. 2. You as the Manager of the Fund will take 50% of the transferable Fund. Most importantly, CONFIDENTIALITY as what I saw as the life wire to the success of the transfer of this Fund must have to be emulated between you and me. You have to use this media to promise me that you will not in anyway expose the content of this transaction to anybody be it your Friends, Colleagues and Co-Workers. I will also want you to send your reply to this email <jh777124@outlook.com> as soon as you get this mail to enable us discuss on the modalities and processes for success of this transaction. Thanks for your anticipated cooperation and understanding. I wait for your kind response. Thanks And Remain blessed. Henry James  "}

{"text": "Hey friend,  I found  a cool site with  some great  stuff for  summer, I thought it may be  helpful to you  too, here is the link http://dcomm2065.aclearerview.com Irina Boutyrskaya  From: Mark.S.Haynes [mailto:Mark.S.Haynes@jpl.nasa.gov] Sent: Sunday, May 07, 2017 3:45 PM To: irina_boutyrskaya@yahoo.com Subject: Big city? In Sweden? I would say  that there is another  possible method  of challenging  the player. In the game, Puzzles  and Dragons, which  IIRC, is more popular in Japan than Brave Frontier, there  are dungeons (basically,  quests) called \"Special Dungeons\"  which  restrict  the  team  composition for  entering the dungeon. For example, one  dungeon might  have only Fire and  Water type units allowed or only units of cost less than  25 or something. With  Fire and Thunder Arena, there was clearly a mechanism that prevented users from participating in the event  with  an illegal team, so  this concept shouldn't be  too difficult  to  implement. With  this, people might have to  be a  bit  more creative in team building than  before. Personally, I feel that Brave  Frontier is  really a game based on macromanagement,  rather than micromanagement, where planning  team compositions, and  which units to  BB train,  are significantly  more important to success than,  say, what items you bring, or how well you spark. This can be seen by the auto-battling  feature, which  allowed  players to  grind with little to no effort. Puzzles and  Dragons on the other  hand,  which I've dabbled  in a bit, has a lot more micro to  it, since you have  to figure out  how you're going to  match your orbs and everything.  Where Puzzles and Dragons falls off a bit in its  American audience, is that it  can get extremely tedious. Plus, it has always irked me significantly with  its nonuniform  art styles, especially  in its collab units,  an aspect that Brave Frontier is far better in.  Sent from Mail for Windows 10 "}

{"text": "Attention, I am David Wilson, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin) as we were instructed. As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project. Best Regards, Mr. David Wilson Head Officer-in-Charge Administrative Service Inspection Unit.  "}
