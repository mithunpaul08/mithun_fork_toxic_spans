{"text": "Hello Alex,\n\nWe are excited to offer you the opportunity to have a certified healthcare worker visit you to administer the Covid-19 vaccine in the comfort of your own home. This is ideal for high-risk patients, those with pre-existing conditions or others who simply do not want to visit a healthcare facility to receive their vaccine. Since this is considered a premium service, we are charging $99. Fortunately, this should be covered by most insurance carriers for qualified patients by going through the claims process.\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out the online form here to make your appointment google.com.
