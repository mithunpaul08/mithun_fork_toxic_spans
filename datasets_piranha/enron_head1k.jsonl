Women wear high heels to bed. \n>>2.? Men are never impotent. \n>>3.? When going down on a woman 10 seconds is more than satisfactory. \n>>4.? If a woman gets busted masturbating by a strange man, she will not \n>>??? scream with embarrassment, but rather insist he have sex with her. \n>>5.Women smile appreciatively when men splat them in the face with sperm. \n>>6.? Women enjoy having sex with ugly, middle-aged men. \n>>7.? Women moan uncontrollably when giving a blowjob. \n>>8.? Women always orgasm when men do. \n>>9.? A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. \n>>10. All women are noisy fucks. \n>>11. People in the 70's couldn't fuck unless there was a wild guitar solo \n>>??? in the background. \n>>12. Those tits are real. \n>>13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his \n>>??? half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt. \n>>14. Men always groan \"OH YEAH!\" when they cum. \n>>15. If there is two of them they \"high five\" each other.(and the girl \n>>??? isn't disgusted!) \n>>16. Double penetration makes women smile. \n>>17. Asian men don't exist. \n>>18. If you come across a guy and his girlfriend having sex in the \n>>??? bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you \n>>??? if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. \n>>19. There's a plot. \n>>20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by \n>>??? giving her a gentle slap on the butt. \n>>21. Nurses suck patient's cocks. \n>>22. Men always pull out. \n>>23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, \n>>??? she'll only be momentarily pissed off before fucking the both of \n>>??? you. \n>>24. Women never have headaches... or periods. \n>>25. When a woman is sucking a man's cock, it's important for him to \n>>??? remind her to \"suck it\". \n>>26. Assholes are clean. \n>>27. A man ejaculating on a woman's butt is a satisfying result for all \n>>??? parties concerned. \n>>28.

For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed\nstopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special\ncontracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the\nliability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death\nof or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven\ndamages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up\nto such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier.\nThe limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and\ncosts except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is\nmade for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum\nof U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers\ntraveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey\nnot to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of\nAmerica, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers\nis limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.\nThe names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at\nall ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.\nAdditional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a\nprivate company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the\ncarrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of\ncarriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance\ncompany representative.\n\nNOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY\nLiability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher\nvalue is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most\ninternational travel (including domestic portions of international journeys)\nthe liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and\n$400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S.\npoints federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to\nbe at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on\ncertain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile,\nvaluable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from\nthe carrier.\n\nCARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED\nA TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR\nREGULATIONS\nSUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS\n\nNOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS\nEffective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of\ncontract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any\ninconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms\nand conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.\n Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S.\n(including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the\nindividual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein\nincorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage.\nForeign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with\nthe U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not\nrestricted to:\n1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death.\n2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods,\nand availability of excess valuation coverage.\n3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file\na claim or bring an action against the air carrier.\n4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.\n5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to\ncarry.\n6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to\nperform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air\ncarriers or aircraft and rerouting.\nYou can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S.\nlocation where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.\n You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air\ncarrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the\nright, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the\napplicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air\ncarriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms\nis available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.\n\nNOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS\n Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that\na seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed\nreservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat\nuntil airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their\nreservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there\nare not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in\naccordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions\npersons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The\ncomplete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding\npriorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding\nlocations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel\nfrom some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be\navailable.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.\n\nRECONFIRMATION NOTICE\nSome international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations.\nContact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.\n\nNOTICE\nIf the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a\ncountry other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention may be\napplicable and the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability\nof carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage\nto baggage.  Se also notices headed \"Advice to International Passengers on\nLimitation of Liability\" and \"Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations\"\nCONDITIONS OF CONTRACT\n1. As used in this contract \"ticket\" means this passenger ticket and baggage\ncheck, of which these conditions and the notices form part, \"carriage\" is\nequivalent to \"transportation\", \"carrier\" means all air carriers that carry\nor undertake to carry the passenger or his baggage hereunder or perform any\nother service incidental to such air carriage.  \"WARSAW CONVENTION\" means\nthe Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to\nInternational Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw, 12th October 1929, or that\nConvention as amended at The Hague, 28th September 1955, whichever may be\napplicable.\n2.

An air carrier issuing a ticket for carriage over the lines of another\nair carrier does so only as its Agent.\n6. Any exclusion or limitation of liability of carrier shall apply to and be\nfor the benefit of agents, servants and representatives of carrier and any\nperson whose aircraft is used by carrier for carriage and its agents,\nservants and representatives.\n7. Checked baggage will be delivered to bearer of the baggage check, in case\nof damage to baggage moving in international transportation complaint must\nbe made in writing to carrier forthwith after discovery of damage and, at\nthe latest, within seven days from receipt; in case of delay, complaint must\nbe made within 21 days from date the baggage was delivered.  See tariffs or\nconditions of carriage regarding non-international transportation.\n8. This ticket is good for carriage for one year from date of issue, except\nas otherwise provided in this ticket, in carrier's tariffs, conditions of\ncarriage, or related regulations.  The fare for carriage hereunder is\nsubject to change prior to commencement of carriage.  Carrier may refuse\ntransportation is the applicable far has not been paid.\n9.

Times shown in timetables or elsewhere\nare not guaranteed and form no part of this contract.  Carrier may without\nnotice substitute alternate carriers or aircraft and may alter or omit\nstopping places shown on the ticket in case of necessity.  Schedules are\nsubject to change without notice.  Carrier assumes no responsibility for\nmaking connections.\n10. Passenger shall comply with Government travel requirements, present\nexit, entry and other required documents and arrive at airport by time fixed\nby carrier, of, if no time is fixed, early enough to complete departure\nprocedures.\n11. No agent, servant or representative of carrier has authority to alter,\nmodify or  waive any provisions of this contract.\n\nCARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED\nA TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER'S TARIFFS, RULES OR\nREGULATIONS\n\nIssued by the Carrier whose name is in the \"Issued By\" section on the face\nof the Passenger Ticket and Baggage Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - C.DTF"}

Football season is\n                                           that special time of year that not \nonly means the beginning of another\n                                           healthy slate of competitive \ngridiron contests filled with spectacular plays\n                                           and high drama--it's also the \ndefinitive rallying point for the onslaught of\n                                           all the expected pomp, pageantry, \nand circumstance that goes\n                                           hand-in-hand with the college \ngame. In no conference in the country is\n                                           this statement more true than the \ntradition-rich Southeastern Conference.\n                                           The ongoing rivalries, the \ncolorful histories and traditions, the premier\n                                           tailgating, the coquettish \nsouthern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion\n                                           of lasting friendships, and the \ncompetitive fire and spirit that accompany\n                                           the game, all make the entire SEC \nfootball experience a very real, and\n                                           visceral one--even to the most \ncasual observer. \n\n                                           The Southeastern Conference is \nunequivocally the paragon of the college\n                                           football conferences, and the 2000 \nseason figures not to disappoint the\n                                           thousands of rabid fans that flock \nto the stadiums each week throughout\n                                           the southeast; as well as the \nmillions more who tune in from home on the\n                                           tube to follow their respective \nteams. Quite frankly, SEC football has\n                                           never been bigger, or better. The \nsouthern cultural phenomenon only\n                                           continues to grow with each \npassing season. The number of fans, and the\n                                           competition that they long for \neach and every weekend of the football\n                                           season, has never been bigger or \nbetter. In 1999, the SEC again set\n                                           attendance records for its games, \nand with the many recent expansions to\n                                           existing stadiums in the \nconference, those records should again fall at the\n                                           end of this season. \n\n                                           Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be \nExcited About the 2000 Football\n                                           Season\n\n                                           1. Lou Tepper is no longer in \nTiger Town.\n\n                                           Heralded by professional defensive \ncoaches as a \"guru\" and a \"defensive\n                                           genius\" prior to his arrival at \nLSU, the former Illinois head coach led the\n                                           LSU defense to its worst two-year \nperformance in the history of the\n                                           school (1893). If you are \ninterested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at\n                                           LSU for your scrapbook, copies of \nhis book \"Complete Linebacking\"\n                                           can still be obtained (at a \ndiscounted price no less) at most local book\n                                           outlets. In Tepper's absence, \nmaybe the Tigers will return to the days of\n                                           coach Charlie Mac and the standout \ndefensive units that were his\n                                           trademark while at the Ole War \nSkule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught\n                                           up with him last week at his home \nand he sounded as spry as a spring\n                                           chicken. He told me that he is \ndoing great and that he enjoys cycling in\n                                           the mornings to stay in shape. \nCoach told me that he hopes that the LSU\n                                           players have fun this year, \nbecause, he said, \"...having fun is what it's all\n                                           about. If you can't have any fun, \nyou're in big trouble.\"\n\n                                           2. Contrary to popular belief, the \nTigers are deep at quarterback.\n\n                                           Preseason prognosticators have \ncited the injury to Rohan Davey as a\n                                           core reason why the Tigers will \nhave trouble at the quarterback position.\n                                           They all opined early that both \nBooty and Nall had difficulties leading the\n                                           offense and that the injury to \nDavey was a major setback to the Tiger\n                                           offense. However, reports from \nsummer camp indicate that Rohan is now\n                                           within 95-100 percent of his \nnormal range of motion on his knee, and in\n                                           light of this it would appear that \nthe Tigers are again three-deep at the\n                                           quarterback position. The \nresurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to\n                                           the team. Known for his leadership \nability both on and off the field,\n                                           Rohan possesses the true grit that \nwins ball games. I caught up with\n                                           former LSU All-American and coach \nGaynell Tinsley at his Highland\n                                           Road home a few weeks ago, and he \ntold me that he thought that\n                                           Rohan's performance against \nArkansas was the best he had ever seen by\n                                           an LSU quarterback. True frosh \nMarcus Randall impressed in the LA\n                                           High School All-Star game last \nweek, but he is a likely redshirt with the\n                                           logjam of experienced competition \nahead of him.\n\n                                           3. Nick Saban.\n\n                                           Derided unfairly early by most SEC \nmedia outlets as being \"incompatible\"\n                                           with Louisianians' unique culture \nand high football expectations, Saban is\n                                           easily the best thing to happen to \nLSU football since Kevin Faulk. A\n                                           consummate professional, Saban \nexudes confidence and paints a clear\n                                           vision for the future of the \nprogram. His presence in Red Stick has made\n                                           an immediate impact on the \nprogram, evidenced by the recent glowing\n                                           comments at media days by seniors \nLouis William and Fred Booker.\n                                           Saban was also unfairly chastised \nheavily by the media for his inability to\n                                           bring any assistants with him to \nLSU from his previous staff at Michigan\n                                           State. However, Coach Saban \nrecently aptly stated at the SEC media\n                                           days that only a couple of his \nprevious staff members had ever been\n                                           \"south of the Mason-Dixon line.\" \nThat notwithstanding, you cannot argue\n                                           with the fact that Saban has \ncompiled a great staff of southern coaches.\n                                           Tiger fans should find further \nsolace in the fact that coach Saban has\n                                           never had a losing record as a \nfootball coach.\n\n                                           4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at \nLinebacker.\n\n                                           All good defenses have a common \ntrait--great linebacking play, and you'll\n                                           be hard-pressed to find two better \nyoung horses than these two.

James' number 11\n                                           Faulk's recent acquisition of \nMealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt\n                                           many fans and commentators to make \ncountless puns and jokes related\n                                           to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.\n\n                                           5.

This story\n                                           should only serve to encourage \nfans that are despondent over the\n                                           outcome of the past two seasons in \nTigertown. Anything can happen in\n                                           the SEC, and remember, the old \nadage says that \"history repeats itself.\"\n\n                                           Keep the faith Tigerfans!\n\n                                           Until next time...\n"}

No sleeping over -- unless it is very good and we need to repeat\n>>> it in the morning.\n>>>\n>>>2. No meeting in public except for dinner or drinks before the\n>>> events of the evening.\n>>>\n>>>3. No calls before 9 PM -- we don't have shit to talk about.\n>>>\n>>>4. None of that \"lovemaking\" shit -- only mind-blowing sex allowed.\n>>>\n>>>5. No emotional discussions -- Ex.: Where are we heading with this?\n>>> Do you love me? The answer is no, so don't ask.\n>>>\n>>>6. No plans made in advance -- that is why you are called the\n>>> \"backup,\" unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-\n>>>time advanced arrangement.\n>>>\n>>>7. All gifts excepted -- money is always good.\n>>>\n>>>8. No baby talk -- however, dirty talk is encouraged.\n>>>\n>>>9. No asking for comparisons with former lovers -- it's really none\n>>> of your damn business.\n>>>\n>>>10. No calling each other \"friends with privileges\" -- we are not\n>>> friends, just sex buddies.\n>>>\n>>>11. Calling out the wrong name during sex is OK -- don't be\n>>> offended.\n>>>\n>>>12. No extra clothing -- I don't want your ass leaving anything\n>>> behind when you leave.\n>>>\n>>>13. No falling asleep right after sex -- it's over, so get your ass\n>>> up and go home.\n>>>\n>>>14. Don't be offended if I don't ask if you enjoyed it -- I don't\n>>> care.\n>>>\n>>>15. You cannot borrow my car for any reason.\n>>>\n>>>16. If anyone asks who you are, the standard response will be: \"My\n>>> roommate's girlfriend/boyfriend.\"\n>>>\n>>>17. Doggie style preferred -- just hit it hard and right or get the\n>>> hell out!\n>>>\n>>>18. Reason for doggie style: the less eye contact the better. I\n>>> don't want to look at you, just fuck you.\n>>>\n>>>19. We hook up absolutely whenever the mood strikes ME -- so don't\n>>> keep calling.\n>>>\n>>>20. The most important one -- no condoms, no fucking. Carry your ass\n>>> home.\n>>>\n>>>21. Bring your own drink -- I am not your liquor store.\n>>>\n>>>22. No phone use, please -- don't want anyone calling back looking\n>>> for your ass.\n>>>\n>>>\n>>> *** EXTRA TIP FOR SUCCESSFUL BOOTY CALLS***\n>>>\n>>> The aforementioned rules may only be altered by the holder of\n>>> the agreement. If the other party attempts to change or alter any\n>>> terms of this Agreement, it will automatically become null\n>>> and void and you will then be removed from the BOOTY CALL LIST and\n>>> deleted from phone memory and email list.

I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members of\nthe ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.\n\nDENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear\nnervous,\nbut I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I\nhave\nto tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the\noutsider,\nthe rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a\nsporting\nevent.\nAnd this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of\nBoomer's\nold squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.\nDAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.\nMILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm\nlooking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I\nput\nmy dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to\nkeep\nup.\nMICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on\nthe\nright foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on\nthe\nWashington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65\nmillion\nin\nfree agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking\nfor\nresults.\nMILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing\nwith\na\npop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to\ncoach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to\nGus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind\nthe\nStairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***\n-chewing\nTurner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that\nlittle\nroom at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you\ncould\ntell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up\nand\nend his ****ing misery.\nMICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the\nkickoff.\nFOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.\nMILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a\nbreather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers\nit's\nholding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's\nstarting,\nand I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to\nthe\n****ing Hakowis.\nMICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at\nMonday\nNight Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.\nMILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle).\nMICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,\nwhom\nI guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.\nMILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he\nhad\nas\nmuch chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.\nThis\nguy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.\nHe's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer\nShow.\nMICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such\nas\nDeion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.\nMILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the\nRedskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's\nappearance\ntonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one\nof\nDr. Evil's monocles.\nMICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds\nthe\nveteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.\nMILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.\nBut\nit seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview\nwith Posh Spice.\nFOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.\nMILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of\nus,\nOK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of\nThe\nMunsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off\non\na\nrant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth\ncould\nbe counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see\nthe\njelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.\nWhen\nI took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe\nthe\nHuman Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback\nwho\nmakes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic\nnetwork programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that\nthis\n**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.\nFOUTS: I like sausage.\nMILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?\nMICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard\nline by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.\nMILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the\nlie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous\ntics\nthan a Belfast valet.\nMICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from\nthe\n49-yard line.\nMILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you\nto\nhell!\nMICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls\nincomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.\nMILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the\nfreakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've\ngot\nWestbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the\nmaximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the\nother\nside is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.\nMICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.\nMILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned\nlike an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to\nGeorge as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing\nCharlie\nSheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of\never -\nMICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of\na\nfalse start, and that will set them back another five yards.\nMILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at\na\ncrack house.\nLater that evening:\nMICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're\nheaded\noff to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see\nyou\nthere.\nMILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing\nMad\nMax with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know\nI'm\nwinning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the\nskylight\nfor ballast.\nMICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,\nD.C.?\nFOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.\nMILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey\nwatching the Banana Channel.\nMICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next\nweek...\n"}

Johnson's  pitch to the Giants' \nCalvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home  plate when it \nstruck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked  up the dead bird \nwith his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson  before taking it to \nthe dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. \"I  didn't think it was \nall that funny,\" he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield \nkilled a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The  Ontario police charged \nhim with animal cruelty, although the charge was later  dropped. \nClick here to link  directly to the story on ESPN's website and see the  \nvideo?\nor\nDownload the video attached to this  email\n - BigUnitHitsDove.avi\n\n\n"}

One day a recruit named\nMarcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw his\nGolden phone sitting there. \"Wow,\" Marcus exclaimed, \"What's that?\"\n Jackie responded, \"Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a direct\nline to Heaven. \"Wow, that's pretty neat,\" Marcus responded. \"Do\nyou think I could make a call on that phone?\"  \"Well yes, but it's\ngoing to cost you about $100. You can make the check out to the\nMississippi State University Football Foundation,\" replied Jackie.\n\"That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much.\nThanks anyway,\" Marcus replied as he left the office.\n\nA few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of Texas\nA&M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office where\nagain he saw a Golden phone.  \"What exactly is that phone for?\"\nasked Marcus.  Coach Slocum replied, \"That's my direct line to\nHeaven.\"   \"Do you think I could make a call from that phone?\"\nasked Marcus.  \"Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $200,\nand you can make the check out to the Texas A&M University\nFoundation.\" replied Slocum.   \"Oh never mind, I don't have that\nkind of money. Thanks though.\"  Marcus shook his head and left\nCoach Slocum's office.\n\nThe next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana State\nUniversity campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop.\nUpon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phone\non Coach Saban's desk.  Marcus asked if that was a direct line to\nHeaven.  When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again asked\nif he could make a call using the phone.  \"Well sure you can, but it\nwill cost you 35 cents,\" replied Saban.  Upon hearing this, Marcus'\neyes got real big and he said, \"Really?  Then why did Coach\nSherrill and Coach Slocum tell me it would cost so much more?\"\nCoach Saban looked up from behind his desk and smiled, saying,\n\"Because, son, here at LSU, it's a local call.\"\n\nL S U --- GO TIGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n"}

Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking \nassets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in \nnew markets.  Is Enron going to be just a trading company?\n\n2.)  If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite \nvolatile.  How could this affect our stock price?  Will Wall Street be \nprepared to accept more volatile earnings?\n\n3.)  Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and \nnew platforms are being introduced into the market place.  Is this going to \nhave a negative effect on Enron's stock price?\n\n4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near \nfuture?\n\n5.)  Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of \nour stock price is based on broadband?\n\nI hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to \ndiscuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatt Lenhart"}

Women wear high heels to bed. \n>>2.? Men are never impotent. \n>>3.? When going down on a woman 10 seconds is more than satisfactory. \n>>4.? If a woman gets busted masturbating by a strange man, she will not \n>>??? scream with embarrassment, but rather insist he have sex with her. \n>>5.Women smile appreciatively when men splat them in the face with sperm. \n>>6.? Women enjoy having sex with ugly, middle-aged men. \n>>7.? Women moan uncontrollably when giving a blowjob. \n>>8.? Women always orgasm when men do. \n>>9.? A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. \n>>10. All women are noisy fucks. \n>>11. People in the 70's couldn't fuck unless there was a wild guitar solo \n>>??? in the background. \n>>12. Those tits are real. \n>>13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his \n>>??? half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt. \n>>14. Men always groan \"OH YEAH!\" when they cum. \n>>15. If there is two of them they \"high five\" each other.(and the girl \n>>??? isn't disgusted!) \n>>16. Double penetration makes women smile. \n>>17. Asian men don't exist. \n>>18. If you come across a guy and his girlfriend having sex in the \n>>??? bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you \n>>??? if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. \n>>19. There's a plot. \n>>20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by \n>>??? giving her a gentle slap on the butt. \n>>21. Nurses suck patient's cocks. \n>>22. Men always pull out. \n>>23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, \n>>??? she'll only be momentarily pissed off before fucking the both of \n>>??? you. \n>>24. Women never have headaches... or periods. \n>>25. When a woman is sucking a man's cock, it's important for him to \n>>??? remind her to \"suck it\". \n>>26. Assholes are clean. \n>>27. A man ejaculating on a woman's butt is a satisfying result for all \n>>??? parties concerned. \n>>28. Women always look pleasantly surprised when they open a man's \n>>??? trousers and find a cock there. \n>>29. Men don't have to beg. \n>>30. When standing during a blowjob, a man will always place one hand \n>>??? firmly on the back of the kneeling woman's head and the other \n>>??? proudly on his hip \n>> \n>> \n> \n\n_________________________________________________________________ \nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com \n\n"}
